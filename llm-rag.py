    "- Empowerment in the context of combining terms or words is about forming new combinations that give an agent (such as a generative model or user) the most real and impactful options in the world of constructed meanings.",
    "- The underlying goal is for the agent to create new terms or items by combining existing words in ways that open up the largest range of realistic, meaningful possibilities.",
    "- A highly empowering combination is one that, once formed, unlocks diverse avenues for interpretation, action, and further combination; it does not trap the agent in a dead-end of narrow or nonsensical meanings.",
    "- For a generative system, maximizing empowerment means producing items whose effects, uses, and potential fit many situations in the real world—opening doors to rich and flexible outcomes.",
    "- When generating a new word from parts, the most empowered outcome is one that could reasonably exist or be understood given existing knowledge, thus affording new connections and opportunities.",
    "- Empowerment here is about expanding the semantic landscape: making sure each new word or concept adds not just a single rigid meaning, but enables multiple plausible paths for future thought or use.",
    "- The more widely applicable and adaptable a new term is, the higher the empowerment associated with its creation.",
    "- If two terms are merged in a way that nobody can relate to or apply meaningfully, future creative options become limited—showing low empowerment.",
    "- If a new word could serve different people, contexts, or purposes, it is highly empowered.",
    "- The system should prefer combinations that allow many interpretations or uses, rather than those that are over-specific or unrealistic and thus shut down creative avenues. For example, inventing “solar bicycle” empowers subsequent ideas: it might lead to thoughts about sustainable transport, energy gadgets, eco-friendly innovation, etc. In a contrasting example, a term like “ice pencil” may afford far fewer meaningful extensions in the practical world (since an actual pencil made of ice is unrealistic and hard to use), thus it is less empowering.",
    "- Empowerment encourages the creation of new items that can be referenced, adapted, or expanded on in future contexts, keeping the creative environment flexible and rich.",
    "- Combining words with empowerment in mind promotes the generation of items that are not only novel but also coherent, familiar, and usable in new conversations or applications.",
    "- This principle discourages verbal combinations that are so abstract, contradictory, or disconnected from reality that they cannot serve as a useful foundation for further ideas or products.",
    "- Ideally, every new word generated maximizes empowerment by providing both clarity of meaning and opportunity for evolution and application.",
    "- Empowerment, applied to word combination, favors practical novelty—where each creation is understandable, potentially useful, and connects well with existing concepts.",
    "- The creator or model should always prefer making items that keep as many opportunities open as possible for themselves or for others who may build upon these new terms.",
    "- Empowerment-guided word creation results in a growing network of meaningful concepts, each unlocking future innovations, explorations, or uses within the language and the world.",
    "- When asked to invent new compound words, targeting empowerment means generating those that invite further exploration, combination, and practical engagement, rather than quickly exhausting their potential."

FLARE_PROMPT = """
You are a creative and analytical agent tasked with maximizing empowerment by selecting item combinations that open up the possibility of generating the greatest number of valid future combinations. Follow these guidelines and use a self-consistent, step-by-step reasoning process internally before delivering your answer.

Inventory Review:
- Examine the current inventory of items.
- Identify potential item pairs that can generate unique, valid new elements in the real world.
- IMPORTANT: Consider the conceptual nature (function, utility, semantic soundness, principle) of the items.

Combination Criteria:
- Select a pair that is most likely to maximize future options according to the concept of Empowerment.
- Avoid pairing items whose combination is semantically similar or redundant.
- Ensure the chosen pair is conceptually and practically valid in the real world. The resultant item should be a meaningful compound or portmanteau of the selected items (e.g., "Bat" and "Human" results in "Batman").

Previously Attempted Pairs:
- Do not repeat any pair that has already been attempted.
- Use the provided list of previously attempted combinations to track history and inform your choices:
- Example: {(item1, item2), result1, 1}, {(item3, item5), None, 0}, {(item2, item10), result2, 1}
Note: Pairs that resulted in None did not adhere to the rule set. Analyze these failures to reduce future None outcomes.

Self-Consistency and Reasoning:
- Use a chain-of-thought approach to evaluate all possibilities rigorously.
- Internally document your reasoning to ensure the selected pair best meets the criteria (do not include this in the final output).
- Ensure your final reasoning is consistent, maximizing future options while avoiding previously tried or semantically similar pairs.

Final Response:
- After completing all internal reasoning, respond ONLY with a Python tuple in the format ('item1', 'item2') representing the chosen combination.

Instructions Recap:
- Work through the reasoning step by step internally.
- Analyze why some attempted pairs resulted in None and use this insight to inform your current decision-making.
- Submit only the final Python tuple without exposing your internal chain-of-thought.
