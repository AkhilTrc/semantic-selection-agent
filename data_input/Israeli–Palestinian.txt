Israeli–Palestinian conflict
The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an
ongoing military and political conflict about
land and self-determination within the
territory
of
the
former
Mandatory
[28][29][30]
Palestine.
Key aspects of the conflict
include the Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, the status of Jerusalem, Israeli
settlements, borders, security, water rights,[31]
the permit regime in the West Bank and in the
Gaza
Strip,

and the Palestinian right of
movement,
return.
The conflict has its origins in the rise of
Zionism in the late 19th century in Europe, a
movement which aimed to establish a Jewish
state
through
the
colonization
of
[33][34]
Palestine,
synchronously with the first
arrival of Jewish settlers to Ottoman Palestine
in 1882.[35] The Zionist movement garnered
the support of an imperial power in the 1917
Balfour Declaration issued by Britain, which
promised to support the creation of a "Jewish
homeland" in Palestine. Following British
occupation of the formerly Ottoman region
during World War I, Mandatory Palestine was
established as a British mandate. Increasing
Jewish immigration led to tensions between
Jews
and
Arabs
which
grew
into
[36][37]
intercommunal conflict.
In 1936, an
Arab revolt erupted demanding independence
and an end to British support for Zionism,
which was suppressed by the British.[38][39]
Eventually tensions led to the United Nations
adopting a partition plan in 1947, triggering a
civil war.
During the ensuing 1948 Palestine war, more
than half of the mandate's predominantly
Palestinian Arab population fled or were
expelled by Israeli forces. By the end of the
war, Israel was established on most of the
former mandate's territory, and the Gaza Strip

and the West Bank were controlled by Egypt
and Jordan respectively.[40][41] Since the 1967
Six-Day War, Israel has been occupying the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, known
collectively as the Palestinian territories. Two
Palestinian uprisings against Israel and its
occupation erupted in 1987 and 2000, the first
and second intifadas respectively. Israel's
occupation resulted in Israel constructing
illegal settlements there, creating a system of
institutionalized
discrimination
against
Palestinians under its occupation called Israeli
apartheid.[42] This discrimination includes
Israel's denial of Palestinian refugees from
their right of return and right to their lost
properties. Israel has also drawn international
condemnation for violating the human rights
of the Palestinians.[43]
The international community, with the
exception of the United States and Israel, has
been in consensus since the 1980s regarding a
settlement of the conflict on the basis of a twostate solution along the 1967 borders and a just
resolution for Palestinian refugees. The United
States and Israel have instead preferred
bilateral negotiations rather than a resolution
of the conflict on the basis of international law.
In recent years, public support for a two-state
solution has decreased, with Israeli policy
reflecting an interest in maintaining the
occupation rather than seeking a permanent
resolution to the conflict. In 2007, Israel
tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip and
made official its policy of isolating it from the
West Bank. Since then, Israel has framed its
relationship with Gaza in terms of the laws of
war rather than in terms of its status as an
occupying power. In a July 2024 ruling, the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) rebuffed
Israel's
stance,
determining
that
the
Palestinian territories constitute one political
unit and that Israel continues to illegally
occupy the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The ICJ
also determined that Israeli policies violate the
International Convention on the Elimination of
All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Since
2006, Hamas and Israel have fought several

186,000[26]– 335,500[g]
development of political Zionism and the
arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine.[35][47]
During the early 20th century, Arab
nationalism also grew within the Ottoman
Empire. To gain support from the Arab
nationalists in the war against the Ottoman
Empire, Great Britain promised support for
the formation of an independent Arab state
in Palestine in the McMahon–Hussein
correspondence.[48] The British Empire
supplied a large amount of weapons to the
Arab revolt 1916-1918.[49] With support from
the Arab revolt the British Empire defeated
the Ottoman's forces and took control of
Palestine, Jordan and Syria. It later
transpired that the British and French

afraid! I will swallow you peacefully..."[46]
In July 1920, the short-lived Arab Kingdom
of Syria, with Emir Faisal (one of the leaders
of the Arab Revolt) as king and tolerated by Britain, was crushed by French armed forces, equipped
with modern artillery.

While Jewish colonization began during this period, it was not until the arrival of more
ideologically Zionist immigrants in the decade preceding the First World War that the landscape of
Ottoman Palestine would start to significantly change.[51] Land purchases, the eviction of tenant
Arab peasants and armed confrontation with Jewish para-military units would all contribute to the
Palestinian population's growing fear of territorial displacement and dispossession.[41] From early
on, the leadership of the Zionist movement had the idea of "transferring" (a euphemism for ethnic
cleansing) the Arab Palestinian population out of the land for the purpose of establishing a Jewish
demographic majority.[52][53][54][55][56] According to the Israeli historian Benny Morris the idea of
transfer was "inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism".[57] The Arab population felt this threat as early
as the 1880s with the arrival of the first aliyah.[41] Chaim Weizmann's efforts to build British
support for the Zionist movement would eventually secure the Balfour Declaration, a public
statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing
support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine.[58]

1920s
With the creation of the British Mandate in Palestine after the end of the first world war, largescale Jewish immigration began accompanied by the development of a separate Jewish-controlled
sector of the economy supported by foreign capital.[59] The more ardent Zionist ideologues of the
Second Aliyah would become the leaders of the Yishuv starting in the 1920s and believed in the
separation of Jewish and Arab societies.[35]
Amin al-Husseini, appointed as Grand Mufti of Jerusalem by the British High Commissioner
Herbert Samuel, immediately marked Jewish national movement and Jewish immigration to
Palestine as the sole enemy to his cause,[60] initiating large-scale riots against the Jews as early as
1920 in Jerusalem and in 1921 in Jaffa. Among the results of the violence was the establishment of
the Jewish paramilitary force Haganah. In 1929, a series of violent riots resulted in the deaths of
133 Jews and 116 Arabs, with significant Jewish casualties in Hebron and Safed, and the
evacuation of Jews from Hebron and Gaza.[61]

1936–1939 Arab revolt
In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine
had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the
Middle East, such as Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam from
Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and
had prepared the grounds for the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in
Palestine. Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of
the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the
Arab general strike and general boycott. The strike soon
deteriorated into violence, and the Arab revolt was bloodily
repressed by the British assisted by the British armed

suppression of the revolt would leave at least 10% of the
adult male population killed, wounded, imprisoned or
exiled.[63] Between the expulsion of much of the Arab
leadership and the weakening of the economy, the Palestinians would struggle to confront the
growing Zionist movement.[64]
The cost and risks associated with the revolt and the ongoing inter-communal conflict led to a shift
in British policies in the region and the appointment of the Peel Commission which recommended
creation of a small Jewish country, which the two main Zionist leaders, Chaim Weizmann and
David Ben-Gurion, accepted on the basis that it would allow for later expansion.[65][66][67] The
subsequent White Paper of 1939, which rejected a Jewish state and sought to limit Jewish
immigration to the region, was the breaking point in relations between British authorities and the
Zionist movement.[68]

The renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning of World War II, ended
with around 5,000 casualties on the Arab side and 700 combined on the British and Jewish side

The more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini, however,
tended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, and participated
in the establishment of a pro-Nazi propaganda machine

Brigade was created in 1944.[72]
By the end of World War II, a crisis over the fate of Holocaust survivors from Europe led to
renewed tensions between the Yishuv and Mandate authorities. By 1944, Jewish groups began to
conduct military-style operations against the British, with the aim of persuading Great Britain to
accept the formation of a Jewish state. This culminated in the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory
Palestine. This sustained Zionist paramilitary campaign of resistance against British authorities,
along with the increased illegal immigration of Jewish refugees and 1947 United Nations partition,
led to eventual withdrawal of the British from Palestine.[73]

strengthened by numerous Jewish veterans of World War II and foreign volunteers. By spring
1948, it was already clear that the Arab forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces
gained more and more territory, creating a large scale refugee problem of Palestinian Arabs.[61]

1948 Arab–Israeli War
Following the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel
on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of
Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British
Palestine, beginning the main phase of the 1948 Arab–Israeli
War.[75] The overall fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties,
resulted in cease-fire and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel
holding much of the former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying
and later annexing the West Bank and Egypt taking over the Gaza
Strip, where the All-Palestine Government was declared by the
Arab League on 22 September 1948.[62] The 1947–1948 civil war in
Mandatory Palestine and 1948 Arab-Israeli War resulted in the
ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinian Arabs.[40] In 1950, Israel
passed the Law of Return, which allowed Jews and their spouses to
become citizens with voting rights, even if they had never lived
there before.

the Palestinian national movement. Gaza Strip then was put under
the authority of the Egyptian military administrator, making it a de
facto military occupation. In 1964, however, a new organization, the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser Arafat.[75] It immediately won the support of most
Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the Arab League.

1967 Six-Day War
In the 1967 Arab-Israel War, Israel occupied the Palestinian West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza
Strip, Egyptian Sinai, Syrian Golan Heights, and two islands in the Gulf of Aqaba.
The war exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian nationalism, as the PLO was unable to
establish any control on the ground and ultimately established its headquarters in Jordan, from
where it supported the Jordanian army during the War of Attrition. However, the Palestinian base
in Jordan collapsed with the Jordanian–Palestinian civil war in 1970, after which the PLO was
forced to relocate to South Lebanon.

In the mid-1970s, the international community converged on a
framework to resolve the conflict through the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. This
"land for peace" proposal was endorsed by the ICJ and UN.[79]

1973 Yom Kippur War
On 6 October 1973, a coalition of Arab forces consisting of mainly
Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on the
Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. Despite this, the war concluded
with an Israeli victory, with both sides suffering tremendous
casualties.
Following the end of the war, the UN Security Council passed
Resolution 338 confirming the land-for-peace principle established
in Resolution 242, initiating the Middle East peace process. The
Arab defeat would play an important role in the PLO's willingness
to pursue a negotiated settlement to the conflict,[80][81] while many
Israelis began to believe that the area under Israeli occupation
could not be held indefinitely by force.[82][83]

During the Six-Day War in
1967, Israel captured the West
Bank, the Gaza Strip, the
Golan Heights and the Sinai
Peninsula. Each of these
territories except the Sinai
remain under Israeli
occupation.

The Camp David Accords, agreed upon by Israel and Egypt in 1978,
primarily aimed to establish a peace treaty between the two
countries. The accords also proposed the creation of a "SelfGoverning Authority" for the Arab population in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, excluding Jerusalem, under Israeli control. A peace treaty based on these accords was
signed in 1979, leading to Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Egyptian Sinai Peninsula by
1982.[84][85]

1982 Lebanon War
During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian militants continued to launch attacks against Israel
while also battling opponents within Lebanon. In 1978, the Coastal Road massacre led to the
Israeli full-scale invasion known as Operation Litani. This operation sought to dislodge the PLO
from Lebanon while expanding the area under the control of the Israeli allied Christian militias in
southern Lebanon. The operation succeeded in leaving a large portion of the south in control of the
Israeli proxy which would eventually form the South Lebanon Army. Under United States
pressure, Israeli forces would eventually withdraw from Lebanon.[86][87][88][89]
In 1982, Israel, having secured its southern border with Egypt, sought to resolve the Palestinian
issue by attempting to dismantle the military and political power of the PLO in Lebanon.[90] The
goal was to establish a friendly regime in Lebanon and continue its policy of settlement and
annexation in occupied Palestine.[91][92][93] The PLO had observed the latest ceasefire with Israel
and shown a preference for negotiations over military operations. As a result, Israel sought to
remove the PLO as a potential negotiating partner.[94][95][96] Most Palestinian militants were
defeated within several weeks, Beirut was captured, and the PLO headquarters were evacuated to
Tunisia in June by Yasser Arafat's decision.[62]

First Intifada (1987–1993)
The first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to Israel's
military occupation, escalating attacks on Palestinians, and policies
of settlement building and collective punishment. The uprising
largely consisted of nonviolent acts of civil disobedience and protest,
and was largely led by grassroots popular, youth, and women's
committees.[97][98] By the early 1990s, the conflict, termed the First
Intifada, was the focus of international settlement efforts, in part
motivated by the success of the Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of
1982. Eventually the Israeli–Palestinian peace process led to the
Oslo Accords of 1993, allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and
take ground in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, establishing the
Palestinian National Authority. The peace process also had
significant opposition among elements of Palestinian society, such as

casualties and a wave of anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime
Minister Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli far-right extremist who
objected to the peace initiative. This struck a serious blow to the peace process, which in 1996 led
to the newly elected government of Israel backing off from the process, to some degree.[61]

Second Intifada (2000–2005)
Following several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the
conflict re-erupted as the Second Intifada in September
2000.[62] The violence, escalating into an open conflict
between the Palestinian National Security Forces and the
Israel Defense Forces, lasted until 2004/2005 and led to
thousands of fatalities. In 2005, Israeli Prime Minister
Sharon ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers
from Gaza. Israel and its Supreme Court formally declared
an end to occupation, saying it "had no effective control
over what occurred" in Gaza.[99] However, the United
Nations, Human Rights Watch and many other
international bodies and NGOs continue to consider Israel
to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel
controls Gaza Strip's airspace, territorial waters and
controls the movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza
by air or sea.[99][100][101]

In 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 44% in the Palestinian parliamentary election. Israel responded
it would begin economic sanctions unless Hamas agreed to accept prior Israeli–Palestinian
agreements, forswear violence, and recognize Israel's right to exist, all of which Hamas
rejected.[102] After internal Palestinian political struggle between Fatah and Hamas erupted into

the 2007 Battle of Gaza, Hamas took full control of the area.[103] In 2007, Israel imposed a naval
blockade on the Gaza Strip, and cooperation with Egypt allowed a ground blockade of the Egyptian
border.
The tensions between Israel and Hamas escalated until late
2008, when Israel launched operation Cast Lead upon
Gaza, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties and
billions of dollars in damage. By February 2009, a ceasefire
was signed with international mediation between the
parties, though the occupation and small and sporadic
eruptions of violence continued.

Israeli air raids continued to occur.[104][105][106][107] In
November 2012, Palestinian representation in the UN was upgraded to a non-member observer
state, and its mission title was changed from "Palestine (represented by PLO)" to "State of
Palestine". In 2014, another war broke out between Israel and Gaza, resulting in over 70 Israeli
and over 2,000 Palestinian casualties.[108]

and clashes in the Palestinian territories.[112]
This culminated in a surprise attack launched by Hamasled militant groups on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip
on 7 October 2023, in which more than 1,200 Israeli
civilians and military personnel were killed, and around
250 were taken hostage into Gaza.[113][114] The Israeli
military retaliated by declaring war on Hamas and
Map of the Gaza war in Gaza and
conducting an extensive aerial bombardment campaign on

Gaza,[115] followed by a large-scale ground invasion with
the stated goal of destroying Hamas, freeing hostages, and
controlling security in Gaza afterwards.[116] Israel killed tens of thousands of Palestinians,
including civilians and combatants and displaced almost two million people.[117] South Africa
accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice and called for an immediate
ceasefire.[118] The court issued an order requiring Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts
contrary to the 1948 Genocide Convention,[119][120][121] but did not order Israel to suspend its
military campaign.[122]
The war spilled over, with Israel engaging in clashes with local militias in the West Bank,
Hezbollah in Lebanon and northern Israel, and other Iranian-backed militias in Syria.[123][124][125]
Iranian-backed militias also engaged in clashes with the United States,[126] while the Houthis
blockaded the Red Sea in protest,[127] to which the United States responded with airstrikes in
Yemen,[128] Iraq, and Syria.[129]

Attempts to reach a peaceful settlement
The PLO's participation in diplomatic negotiations was dependent on its complete disavowal of
terrorism and recognition of Israel's "right to exist." This stipulation required the PLO to abandon
its objective of reclaiming all of historic Palestine and instead focus on the 22 percent which came
under Israeli military control in 1967.[130] By the late 1970s, Palestinian leadership in the occupied
territories and most Arab states supported a two-state settlement.[131] In 1981, Saudi Arabia put
forward a plan based on a two-state settlement to the conflict with support from the Arab
League.[132] Israeli analyst Avner Yaniv describes Arafat as ready to make a historic compromise at
this time, while the Israeli cabinet continued to oppose the existence of a Palestinian state. Yaniv
described Arafat's willingness to compromise as a "peace offensive" which Israel responded to by
planning to remove the PLO as a potential negotiating partner in order to evade international
diplomatic pressure.[133] Israel would invade Lebanon the following year in an attempt to
undermine the PLO as a political organization, weakening Palestinian nationalism and facilitating
the annexation of the West Bank into Greater Israel.[92]
While the PLO had adopted a program of pursuing a Palestinian state alongside Israel since the
mid-1970s, the 1988 Palestinian Declaration of Independence formally consecrated this objective.
This declaration, which was based on resolutions from the Palestine National Council sessions in
the late 1970s and 1980s, advocated for the creation of a Palestinian state comprising the West
Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, within the borders set by the 1949 armistice lines prior to 5
June 1967. Following the declaration, Arafat explicitly denounced all forms of terrorism and
affirmed the PLO's acceptance of UN Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as the recognition of Israel's
right to exist. All the conditions defined by Henry Kissinger for US negotiations with the PLO had
now been met.[134]
Then-Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir stood behind the stance that the PLO was a terrorist
organization. He maintained a strict stance against any concessions, including withdrawal from
occupied Palestinian territories, recognition of or negotiations with the PLO, and especially the
establishment of a Palestinian state. Shamir viewed the U.S. decision to engage in dialogue with
the PLO as a mistake that threatened the existing territorial status quo. He argued that negotiating
with the PLO meant accepting the existence of a Palestinian state and hence was unacceptable.[135]

The peace process
The term "peace process" refers to the step-by-step approach to resolving the conflict. Having
originally entered into usage to describe the US mediated negotiations between Israel and
surrounding Arab countries, notably Egypt, the term "peace-process" has grown to be associated
with an emphasis on the negotiation process rather than on presenting a comprehensive solution
to the conflict.[136][137][138] As part of this process, fundamental issues of the Israeli–Palestinian
conflict such as borders, access to resources, and the Palestinian right of return, have been left to
"final status" talks. Such "final status" negotiations along the lines discussed in Madrid in 1991
have never taken place.[138]
The Oslo Accords of 1993 and 1995 built on the incremental framework put in place by the 1978
Camp David negotiations and the 1991 Madrid and Washington talks. The motivation behind the
incremental approach towards a settlement was that it would "build confidence", but the eventual
outcome was instead a dramatic decline in mutual confidence. At each incremental stage, Israel

further entrenched its occupation of the Palestinian territories, despite the PA upholding its
obligation to curbing violent attacks from extremist groups, in part by cooperating with Israeli
forces.[139]
Meron Benvenisti, former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, observed that life became harsher for
Palestinians during this period as state violence increased and Palestinian land continued to be
expropriated as settlements expanded.[140][141][142][143] Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami
described the Oslo Accords as legitimizing "the transformation of the West Bank into what has
been called a 'cartographic cheeseboard'."[144]
Creation of the Palestinian Authority and security cooperation
Core to the Oslo Accords was the creation of the Palestinian Authority and the security cooperation
it would enter into with the Israeli military authorities in what has been described as the
"outsourcing" of the occupation to the PA.[130] Just before signing the Oslo accord, Rabin
described the expectation that the "Palestinians will be better at establishing internal security than
we were, because they will allow no appeals to the Supreme Court and will prevent [human rights
groups] from criticizing the conditions there."[145] Along these lines, Ben-Ami, who participated in
the Camp David 2000 talks, described this process: "One of the meanings of Oslo was that the PLO
was eventually Israel's collaborator in the task of stifling the Intifada and cutting short what was
clearly an authentically democratic struggle for Palestinian independence."[144]
The Wye River Memorandum agreed on by the PA and Israel introduced a "zero tolerance" policy
for "terror and violence." This policy was uniformly criticized by human rights organizations for its
"encouragement" of human rights abuses.[146][147] Dennis Ross describes the Wye as having
successfully reduced both violent and non-violent protests, both of which he considers to be
"inconsistent with the spirit of Wye."[148] Watson claims that the PA frequently violated its
obligations to curb incitement[149] and its record on curbing terrorism and other security
obligations under the Wye River Memorandum was, at best, mixed.[150]

In 1993, Israeli officials led by Yitzhak Rabin and
Palestinian leaders from the Palestine Liberation
Organization led by Yasser Arafat strove to find a peaceful
solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process. A crucial milestone in this process
was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist. Emblematic of the asymmetry in the Oslo
process, Israel was not required to, and did not, recognize the right of a Palestinian state to exist.
In 1993, the Declaration of Principles (or Oslo I) was signed and set forward a framework for
future Israeli–Palestinian negotiations, in which key issues would be left to "final status" talks. The
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_conflict

stipulations of the Oslo agreements ran contrary to the international consensus for resolving the
conflict; the agreements did not uphold Palestinian self-determination or statehood and repealed
the internationally accepted interpretation of UN Resolution 242 that land cannot be acquired by
war.[141] With respect to access to land and resources, Noam Chomsky described the Oslo
agreements as allowing "Israel to do virtually what it likes."[151] The Oslo process was delicate and
progressed in fits and starts.
The process took a turning point at the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995 and the
election of Netanyahu in 1996, finally unraveling when Arafat and Ehud Barak failed to reach an
agreement at Camp David in July 2000 and later at Taba in 2001.[136][152] The interim period
specified by Oslo had not built confidence between the two parties; Barak had failed to implement
additional stages of the interim agreements and settlements expanded by 10% during his short
term.[153] The disagreement between the two parties at Camp David was primarily on the
acceptance (or rejection) of international consensus.[154][155] For Palestinian negotiators, the
international consensus, as represented by the yearly vote in the UN General Assembly which
passes almost unanimously, was the starting point for negotiations. The Israeli negotiators,
supported by the American participants, did not accept the international consensus as the basis for
a settlement.[156] Both sides eventually accepted the Clinton parameters "with reservations" but
the talks at Taba were "called to a halt" by Barak, and the peace process itself came to a standstill.[152] Ben-Ami, who participated in the talks at Camp David as Israel's foreign minister, would
later describe the proposal on the table: "The Clinton parameters... are the best proof that Arafat
was right to turn down the summit's offers".[154]

Camp David Summit (2000)
In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Barak reportedly put forward the following
as "bases for negotiation", via the US to the Palestinian President: a non-militarized Palestinian
state split into 3–4 parts containing 87–92% of the West Bank after having already given up 78%
of historic Palestine.[h] Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent of the West Bank (5,538 km2 of the West
Bank translates into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective),[157] including Arab parts of
East Jerusalem and the entire Gaza Strip,[158][159] as well as a stipulation that 69 Jewish
settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank's Jewish settlers) would be ceded to Israel, no
right of return to Israel, no sovereignty over the Temple Mount or any core East Jerusalem
neighbourhoods, and continued Israel control over the Jordan Valley.[160][161]
Arafat rejected this offer,[158] which Palestinian negotiators, Israeli analysts and Israeli Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami described as "unacceptable".[152][162] According to the Palestinian
negotiators the offer did not remove many of the elements of the Israeli occupation regarding land,
security, settlements, and Jerusalem.[163]
After the Camp David summit, a narrative emerged, supported by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and his foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, as well as US officials including Dennis Ross and
Madeleine Albright, that Yasser Arafat had rejected a generous peace offer from Israel and instead
incited a violent uprising. This narrative suggested that Arafat was not interested in a two-state
solution, but rather aimed to destroy Israel and take over all of Palestine. This view was widely
accepted in US and Israeli public opinion. Nearly all scholars and most Israeli and US officials

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_conflict

12/73

7/16/25, 9:56 AM

involved in the negotiations have rejected this narrative. These individuals include prominent
Israeli negotiators, the IDF chief of staff, the head of the IDF's intelligence bureau, the head of the
Shin Bet as well as their advisors.[164]
No tenable solution was crafted which would satisfy both Israeli and Palestinian demands, even
under intense US pressure. Clinton has long blamed Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[165] In
the months following the summit, Clinton appointed former US Senator George J. Mitchell to lead
a fact-finding committee aiming to identify strategies for restoring the peace process. The
committee's findings were published in 2001 with the dismantlement of existing Israeli
settlements and Palestinian crackdown on militant activity being one strategy.[166]

Developments following Camp David
Following the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators continued to meet in small groups through
August and September 2000 to try to bridge the gaps
between their respective positions. The United States
prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues.
Clinton's presentation of the US proposals was delayed by
the advent of the Second Intifada at the end of
September.[163]
Clinton's plan, eventually presented on 23 December
Israeli West Bank barrier in Bethlehem
2000, proposed the establishment of a sovereign
Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and 94–96 percent of
the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1–3 percent of the West Bank in land swaps from pre-1967
Israel. On Jerusalem, the plan stated that "the general principle is that Arab areas are Palestinian
and that Jewish areas are Israeli." The holy sites were to be split on the basis that Palestinians
would have sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Noble sanctuary, while the Israelis would have
sovereignty over the Western Wall. On refugees, the plan suggested a number of proposals
including financial compensation, the right of return to the Palestinian state, and Israeli
acknowledgment of suffering caused to the Palestinians in 1948. Security proposals referred to a
"non-militarized" Palestinian state, and an international force for border security. Both sides
accepted Clinton's plan[163][167][168] and it became the basis for the negotiations at the Taba Peace
summit the following January.[163]

Taba Summit (2001)
The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the Taba Summit in Taba, Egypt, in January
2001. The proposition removed the "temporarily Israeli controlled" areas, and the Palestinian side
accepted this as a basis for further negotiation. With Israeli elections looming the talks ended
without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement attesting to the progress they had
made: "The sides declare that they have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus
our shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of negotiations
following the Israeli elections." The following month the Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon
defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 7
February 2001. Sharon's new government chose not to resume the high-level talks.[163]

Road map for peace (2002–2003)
One peace proposal, presented by the Quartet of the
European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the
United States on 17 September 2002, was the Road Map
for Peace. This plan did not attempt to resolve difficult
questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli
settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of
the process. The proposal never made it beyond the first
phase, whose goals called for a halt to both Israeli
settlement construction and Israeli–Palestinian violence.
Neither goal has been achieved as of November
2015.[169][170][171]
The Annapolis Conference was a Middle East peace
conference held on 27 November 2007, at the United
States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, United
States. The conference aimed to revive the Israeli–
Palestinian peace process and implement the "Roadmap
for peace".[172] The conference ended with the issuing of a
joint statement from all parties. After the Annapolis
Conference, the negotiations were continued. Both
Mahmoud Abbas and Ehud Olmert presented each other
with competing peace proposals. Ultimately no agreement
was reached.[173][174]

normalization of relations with Israel, in exchange for the
withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied territories, including
the Golan Heights, to recognize "an independent Palestinian state
with East Jerusalem as its capital" in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, as well as a "just solution" for the Palestinian refugees.[176]

factions rejecting the plan.[180] Palestinians have criticised the Israel–United Arab Emirates
normalization agreement and another with Bahrain signed in September 2020, fearing the moves
weaken the Arab Peace Initiative, regarding the UAE's move as "a betrayal."[181]
The Israeli government under Ariel Sharon rejected the initiative as a "non-starter"[182] because it
required Israel to withdraw to pre-June 1967 borders.[183] After the renewed Arab League
endorsement in 2007, then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gave a cautious welcome to the plan.[184]
In 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed tentative support for the
Initiative,[185] but in 2018, he rejected it as a basis for future negotiations with the
Palestinians.[186]

Current status
Apartheid
In July 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that Israeli policies violate the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.[187] As of
2022, all the major Israeli and international human rights organizations were in agreement that
Israeli actions constituted the crime of apartheid.[42] In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released
its report A Threshold Crossed, describing the policies of Israel towards Palestinians living in
Israel, the West Bank and Gaza constituted the crime of apartheid.[188] A further report titled
Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime Against
Humanity was released by Amnesty International on 1 February 2022.[189]
In 2018, the Knesset passed the Nation-State law which the Israeli legal group Adalah nicknamed
the "Apartheid law." Adalah described the Nation-State law as "constitutionally enshrining Jewish
supremacy and the identity of the State of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people." The
Nation-State law is a Basic Law, meaning that it has "quasi-constitutional status,"[190] and states
that the right to exercise national self-determination in Israel is "unique to the Jewish people".[191]

Occupied Palestinian territory
Israel has occupied the Palestinian territories, which
comprise the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and
the Gaza Strip, since the 1967 Six-Day War, making it the
longest military occupation in modern history.[192] In
2024, the International Court of Justice determined that
the Palestinian territories constitute one political unit and
that Israel's occupation since 1967, and the subsequent
creation of Israeli settlements and exploitation of natural
resources, are illegal under international law. The court
also ruled that Israel should pay full reparations to the
Palestinian people for the damage the occupation has
caused.[193][194]

7/16/25, 9:56 AM

this land is open for discussion.[195] Palestinians claim any reduction of this claim is a severe
deprivation of their rights. In negotiations, they claim that any moves to reduce the boundaries of
this land is a hostile move against their key interests. Israel considers this land to be in dispute and
feels the purpose of negotiations is to define what the final borders will be. In 2017 Hamas
announced that it was ready to support a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders "without
recognising Israel or ceding any rights".[196]
Israeli settlements

settlements to be illegal under international
law,[197][198][199][200]

this.
Those who justify the legality
of the settlements use arguments based upon
Articles 2 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention,
as well as UN Security Council Resolution 242.[205]
The expansion of settlements often involves the
confiscation of Palestinian land and resources,
leading to displacement of Palestinian communities
and creating a source of tension and conflict.
A neighbourhood in the settlement of Ariel in the
Settlements are often protected by the Israeli
Israeli occupied West Bank, which is home to the

against Palestinians. Furthermore, the presence of
settlements and Jewish-only bypass roads creates a
fragmented Palestinian territory, seriously hindering
economic development and freedom of movement for
Palestinians.[206] Amnesty International reports that
Israeli settlements divert resources needed by Palestinian
towns, such as arable land, water, and other resources;
and, that settlements reduce Palestinians' ability to travel
freely via local roads, owing to security considerations.[206]
As of 2023, there were about 500,000 Israeli settlers living
Israeli settlers in Hebron, West Bank
in the West Bank, with another 200,000 living in East
Jerusalem.[207][208][209] In February 2023, Israel's
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich took charge of most of the Civil Administration, obtaining
broad authority over civilian issues in the West Bank.[210][211] In the first six months of 2023,
13,000 housing units were built in settlements, which is almost three times more than in the whole
of 2022.[212]
Israeli military police
In a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the three-year period of 2011–2013,
Amnesty International stated that Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and
in some instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be tantamount to war crimes.
Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had
been gravely injured by Israeli use of live ammunition. In this same period, 45 Palestinians,
including 6 children had been killed. Amnesty's review of 25 civilian deaths concluded that in no
case was there evidence of the Palestinians posing an imminent threat. At the same time, over
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_conflict

8,000 Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including rubber-coated metal
bullets. Only one IDF soldier was convicted, killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel
illegally. The soldier was demoted and given a 1-year sentence with a five-month suspension. The
IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself "to the highest of professional
standards", adding that when there was suspicion of wrongdoing, it investigated and took action
"where appropriate".[213][214]

Separation of the Gaza Strip
Since 2006, Israel has enforced an official and explicit policy of enforcing "separation" between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.[215] This separation policy has involved strict restrictions on imports,
exports and travel to and from the Gaza Strip.[216] This policy began to develop as early as the
1950s, but was further formalized with the implementation of an Israeli closure regime in 1991,
where Israel began requiring Gazans to obtain permits to exit the Gaza Strip and to enter the West
Bank (cancelling the "general exit permit"). By treating the Gaza Strip as a separate entity, Israel
has aimed to increase its control over the West Bank while avoiding a political resolution to the
conflict.[217][218] The lack of territorial contiguity between Gaza and the West Bank and the
absence of any "safe passage" explain the success of Israel's policy of separation.[219] Harvard
political economist Sara Roy describes the separation policy as motivated by Israeli rejection of
territorial compromise, fundamentally undermining Palestinian political and economic cohesion
and weakening national unity among Palestinians.[220][221]
The severing of Gaza from the West Bank hinterland reflects a paradigm shift in the framing of the
conflict. After Hamas assumed power in 2007, Israel declared Gaza a "hostile territory," preferring
to frame its obligations towards Gaza in terms of the law of armed conflict, over what it presented
as a border dispute, as opposed to those of military occupation[219][222] (this framing was rebuffed
by the ICJ in 2024 when the court stated that Israel continued to occupy the Gaza Strip even after
the 2005 disengagement).[223] Indeed, the intensified blockade policy was presented by Israeli
officials as "economic warfare" intended to "keep the Gazan economy on the brink of collapse" at
the "lowest possible level."[219] Roy cites an Israeli Supreme Court's decision approving fuel cuts to
Gaza as emblematic of the disabling of Gaza; the court deemed the fuel cuts permissible on the
basis that they would not harm the population's "essential humanitarian needs."
The executive director of the Israeli human rights organization Gisha described Israeli policy
towards Gaza between 2007 and 2010 as "explicitly punitive," controlling the entry of food based
on calculated calorie needs to limit economic activity and enforce "economic warfare." These
restrictions included allowing only small packets of margarine to prevent local food production.
Gaza's GDP dramatically declined during this period as a result of these measures.[224] Indeed, by
April 2010 Israel restricted the entry of commercial items to Gaza to a list of 73 products,
compared with 4,000 products which had previously been approved. The result was the virtual
collapse of Gaza's private sector, which Roy describes as largely completed after the 2008 Israeli
Operation Cast Lead in Gaza.[220] According to Gisha, travel restrictions from the Gaza Strip are
not based on individual security concerns, rather, the general rule is that travel to Israel or the
West Bank from Gaza is not permitted other than in "exceptional" cases.[225] Israeli imposed travel
restrictions aim in particular to prevent Gazans from living in the West Bank. Indeed, Israeli policy
treats the Gaza Strip as a "terminus" station, with family reunification between the West Bank and
Gaza Strip only possible if the family agrees to permanently relocate to the Gaza Strip.[226] The
Israeli officials described the blockade as serving limited security value, instead referring to these
restrictions as motivated by "political-security."[227]

Blockade of the Gaza Strip
Although closure has a long history in Gaza dating back to
1991 when it was first imposed, it was made more acute
after 2000 with the start of the second intifada. Closure
was tightened further after the 2005 disengagement and
then again in 2006, after Hamas's electoral victory.[221]
Heightened restrictions were imposed on imports and
exports as well as on the movement of people, including
Gaza's labor force. The total siege of Gaza that was
imposed following the Hamas led attack on Israel during 7
October 2023, was part of that same policy of separation
Israel's attack on Gaza in 2009
and closure, characterized by the destruction of Gaza's
infrastructure (especially housing) and the denial of food,
water, electricity, and fuel to its population.[219] On 9
October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas and tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip.[228]
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared, "There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel,
everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly."[229][230]
Since its initiation, blockade has had a detrimental impact on the private sector in Gaza, the
primary driver of economic growth in Gaza. Prior to the blockade, Gaza imported 95% of its inputs
for manufacturing and exported 85% of the finished products (primarily to Israel and the West
Bank). Employment in this sector dropped to 4% by 2010, with an overall unemployment rate of
40% at this time and 80% of the population living on less than 2 dollars a day.[231] Fewer than 40
commercial items were allowed in to the Gaza Strip by 2009, compared to a list of 4,000 items
before the start of the blockade. Fuel imports were restricted such that 95% of Gaza's industrial
operations were forced to close, with the rest operating far below capacity. In aggregate, 100,000
out of the 120,000 employed in the private sector lost their jobs as a result of the blockade. Most
critically for the economy has been the near complete ban on exports from the Gaza Strip. The
number of truckloads carrying exports fell to 2% their pre-blockade numbers. Only exports to the
European market were allowed, a far less profitable market for Gazans than Israel and the West
Bank. The products approved for export were primarily flowers and strawberries. The first export
to the West Bank or Israel did not happen until 2012 and only in very limited quantities: up to four
truckloads of furniture manufactured in Gaza were allowed through Israel for an exhibition in
Amman.[221]
Even in the early years of Israeli imposed closure, the associated increased cost of doing business
had a detrimental impact on trade. Goods transferred between the West Bank, Gaza, and Israel
were required to be loaded onto Palestinian trucks initially and then off loaded onto Israeli trucks
at the border even for distances of 50–100 miles. These increased costs include the costs for
security checks, clearance, storage, and spoilage, as well as increased transportation costs.[232]
The Military Advocate General of Israel said that Israel is justified under international law to
impose a blockade on an enemy for security reasons as Hamas "turned the territory under its de
facto control into a launching pad of mortar and rocket attacks against Israeli towns and villages in
southern Israel."[233] Media headlines have described a United Nations commission as ruling that
Israel's blockade is "both legal and appropriate."[234][235] However, Amnesty International has
stated that this is "completely false," and that the cited UN report made no such claim.[236] The

Israeli Government's continued land, sea and air blockage is tantamount to collective punishment
of the population, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs.[237]
In January 2008, the Israeli government calculated how many calories per person were needed to
prevent a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, and then subtracted eight percent to adjust for the
"culture and experience" of the Gazans. Details of the calculations were released following Israeli
human rights organization Gisha's application to the high court. Israel's Coordinator of
Government Activities in the Territories, who drafted the plan, stated that the scheme was never
formally adopted, this was not accepted by Gisha.[238][239][240]
On 20 June 2010, in response to the Gaza flotilla raid, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new
system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use items to
enter the Gaza Strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel would "expand the transfer of
construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian
Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more—as well as (projects)
that are under international supervision."[241] Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel will
continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of Ashdod.[242] Despite these
announcements, the economic situation did not substantially change and the virtual complete ban
on exports remained in place. Only some consumer products and material for donor-sponsored
projects was allowed in.[243]

United Nations and recognition of Palestinian
statehood
The PLO have campaigned for full member status for the
state of Palestine at the UN and for recognition on the 1967
borders. This campaign has received widespread
support.[244][245] The UN General Assembly votes every
year almost unanimously in favor of a resolution calling for
the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967
borders.[246] The US and Israel instead prefer to pursue
bilateral negotiation rather than resolving the conflict on
the basis of international law.[247][248] Netanyahu has
criticized the Palestinians of purportedly trying to bypass
direct talks,[249] whereas Abbas has argued that the
continued construction of Israeli-Jewish settlements is
"undermining the realistic potential" for the two-state
solution.[250] Although Palestine has been denied full
member status by the UN Security Council,[251] in late
2012 the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved
the de facto recognition of sovereign Palestine by granting
non-member state status.[252]

incitement against Israel, Jews, and Zionism continued, parallel with Israel's pursuance of
settlements in the Palestinian territories,[253] though under Abu Mazen it has reportedly dwindled

significantly.[254] Charges of incitement have been reciprocal,[255][256] both sides interpreting
media statements in the Palestinian and Israeli press as constituting incitement.[254] Schoolbooks
published for both Israeli and Palestinian schools have been found to have encouraged a one-sided
narrative and at times hatred of the other side.[257][258][259][260][261][262] Perpetrators of
murderous attacks, whether against Israelis or Palestinians, often find strong vocal support from
sections of their communities despite varying levels of condemnation from
politicians.[263][264][265]
Both parties to the conflict have been criticized by third-parties for teaching incitement to their
children by downplaying the other side's historical ties to the area, teaching propagandist maps, or
indoctrinating their children to one day join the armed forces.[266][267]

Issues in dispute
The core issues of the conflict are borders, the status of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the
status of Jerusalem, the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and security.[137][141][268][269]
With the PLO's recognition of Israel's "right to exist" in 1982,[151] the international community
with the main exception of the United States and Israel[270][271] has been in consensus on a
framework for resolving the conflict on the basis of international law.[272] Various UN bodies and
the ICJ have supported this position;[272][137] every year, the UN General Assembly votes almost
unanimously in favor of a resolution titled "Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine." This
resolution consistently affirms the illegality of the Israeli settlements, the annexation of East
Jerusalem, and the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. It also
emphasizes the need for an Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967
and the need for a just resolution to the refugee question on the basis of UN resolution 194.[246]
Unilateral strategies and the rhetoric of hardline political factions, coupled with violence, have
fostered mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in the possibility of reaching a
peaceful settlement. Since the break down of negotiations, security has played a less important role
in Israeli concerns, trailing behind employment, corruption, housing and other pressing
issues.[273] Israeli policy had reoriented to focus on managing the conflict and the associated

territory,

solution.
The expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank has led the
majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel is not committed to reaching an agreement, but
rather to a pursuit of establishing permanent control over this territory in order to provide that
security.[277]

Status of Jerusalem
In 1967, Israel unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem, in violation of international law. Israel seized a
significant area further east of the city, eventually creating a barrier of Israeli settlements around
the city, isolating Jerusalem's Palestinian population from the West Bank.[278] Israel's policy of
constructing sprawling Jewish neighborhoods surrounding the Palestinian sections of the city were
aimed at making a repartition of the city almost impossible. In a further effort to change the
demography of Jerusalem in favor of a Jewish majority, Israel discouraged Palestinian presence in
the city while encouraging Jewish presence, as a matter of policy. Specifically, Israel introduced
policies restricting the space available for the construction of Palestinian neighborhoods, delaying

or denying building permits and raising housing
demolition orders.[279] Tensions in Jerusalem are
primarily driven by provocations by Israeli authorities and
Jewish extremists against Arabs in the city.[280]
The Israeli government, including the Knesset and
Supreme Court, is located in the "new city" of West
Jerusalem and has been since Israel's founding in 1948.
After Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, it assumed
complete administrative control of East Jerusalem. Since
then, various UN bodies have consistently denounced
Israel's control over East Jerusalem as invalid.[279] In
1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law declaring
"Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of
Israel."[281]

international organizations do not recognize Israel's claims
to East Jerusalem which occurred after the 1967 Six-Day
War, nor its 1980 Jerusalem Law proclamation.[284] The
International Court of Justice in its 2004 Advisory opinion on the "Legal Consequences of the
Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory" described East Jerusalem as
"occupied Palestinian territory".[285]
The three largest Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—hold Jerusalem as an
important setting for their religious and historical narratives. Jerusalem is the holiest city in
Judaism, being the former location of the Jewish temples on the Temple Mount and the capital of
the ancient Israelite kingdom. For Muslims, Jerusalem is the third holiest site, being the location
of the Isra' and Mi'raj event, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. For Christians, Jerusalem is the site of
Jesus' crucifixion and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
Holy sites and the Temple Mount
Since the early 20th century, the issue of holy
places and particularly the sacred places in
Jerusalem has been employed by nationalist
politicians.[286]
Israelis did not have access to the holy places
in East Jerusalem during the period of
Panorama of the Western Wall with the Dome of the
Jordanian rule.[287] Since 1975, Israel has
Rock (left) and al-Aqsa mosque (right) in the background
banned Muslims from worshiping at Joseph's
Tomb, a shrine considered sacred by both
Jews and Muslims. Settlers established a yeshiva, installed a Torah scroll and covered the mihrab.
During the Second Intifada Palestinian protesters looted and burned the site.[288][289] Israeli
security agencies routinely monitor and arrest Jewish extremists that plan attacks, though many
serious incidents have still occurred.[290] Israel has allowed almost complete autonomy to the
Muslim trust (Waqf) over the Temple Mount.[279]

Palestinians have voiced concerns regarding the welfare of Christian and Muslim holy places under
Israeli control.[291] Additionally, some Palestinian advocates have made statements alleging that
the Western Wall Tunnel was re-opened with the intent of causing the mosque's collapse.[292]

Palestinian refugees
Palestinian refugees are people who lost both their homes and
means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict[293]
and the 1967 Six-Day War.[294] The number of Palestinians who
were expelled or fled from Israel was estimated at 711,000 in
1949.[295] The descendants of all refugees (not just Palestinian
refugees)[296] are considered by the UN to also be refugees. As of
2010 there are 4.7 million Palestinian refugees.[297] Between
350,000 and 400,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1967
Arab–Israeli war.[294] A third of the refugees live in recognized
refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip. The remainder live in and around the cities and towns
of these host countries.[293] Most Palestinian refugees were born
outside Israel and are not allowed to live in any part of historic
Palestine.[293][298]

Palestinian refugees, 1948

Israel has since 1948 prevented the return of Palestinian refugees
and refused any settlement permitting their return except in limited cases.[151][299][300] On the
basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and UN General Assembly Resolution 194,
Palestinians claim the right of refugees to return to the lands, homes and villages where they lived
before being driven into exile in 1948 and 1967. Arafat himself repeatedly assured his American
and Israeli interlocutors at Camp David that he primarily sought the principle of the right of return
to be accepted, rather than the full right of return, in practice.[301]
Palestinian and international authors have justified the right of return of the Palestinian refugees
on several grounds:[302][303][304] Several scholars included in the broader New Historians argue
that the Palestinian refugees fled or were chased out or expelled by the actions of the Haganah,
Lehi and Irgun, Zionist paramilitary groups.[305][306] A number have also characterized this as an
ethnic cleansing.[307][308][309][310] The New Historians cite indications of Arab leaders' desire for
the Palestinian Arab population to stay put.[311]
The Israeli Law of Return that grants citizenship to people of Jewish descent has been described as
discriminatory against other ethnic groups, especially Palestinians that cannot apply for such
citizenship under the law of return, to the territory which they were expelled from or fled during
the course of the 1948 war.[312][313][314]
According to the UN Resolution 194, adopted in 1948, "the refugees wishing to return to their
homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest
practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to
return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in
equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible."[315] UN Resolution
3236 "reaffirms also the inalienable right of the Palestinians to return to their homes and property
from which they have been displaced and uprooted, and calls for their return".[316] Resolution 242

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_conflict

7/16/25, 9:56 AM

from the UN affirms the necessity for "achieving a just settlement of
the refugee problem"; however, Resolution 242 does not specify
that the "just settlement" must or should be in the form of a literal
Palestinian right of return.[317]
Historically, there has been debate over the relative impact of the
causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus, although there is a wide
consensus that violent expulsions by Zionist and Israeli forces were
the main factor. Other factors include psychological warfare and
Arab sense of vulnerability. Notably, historian Benny Morris states
that most of Palestine's 700,000 refugees fled because of the "flail
of war" and expected to return home shortly after a successful Arab
invasion. He documents instances in which Arab leaders advised
the evacuation of entire communities as happened in Haifa
Home in Balata refugee camp
although recognizes that these were isolated events.[305][318] In his
demolished during the second
later work, Morris considers the displacement the result of a
Intifada, 2002
[318]
national conflict initiated by the Arabs themselves.
In a 2004
interview with Haaretz, he described the exodus as largely resulting
from an atmosphere of transfer that was promoted by Ben-Gurion and understood by the military
leadership. He also claimed that there "are circumstances in history that justify ethnic
cleansing".[319] He has been criticized by political scientist Norman Finkelstein for having
seemingly changed his views for political, rather than historical, reasons.[320]
Although Israel accepts the right of the Palestinian
Diaspora to return into a new Palestinian state, Israel
insists that the return of this population into the current
state of Israel would threaten the stability of the Jewish
state; an influx of Palestinian refugees would lead to the
end of the state of Israel as a Jewish state since a
demographic majority of Jews would not be
maintained.[321][322][323]

Throughout the conflict, Palestinian violence has been a
concern for Israelis. Security concerns have historically
been a key driver in Israeli political decision making, often
expanding in scope and taking precedence over other
considerations such as international law and Palestinian
human rights.[324][325][326] The occupation of the West
Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the continued expansion
of settlements in those areas have been justified on security
grounds.[327]

Nations General Assembly resolution A/RES/45/130 reflects an international consensus (113 out
of 159 voting nations voted in favor, 13 voted against[332]) affirming Palestinians' legitimacy, as a
people under foreign occupation, to use armed struggle to resist said occupation.[333]
In Israel, Palestinian suicide bombers have targeted civilian buses, restaurants, shopping malls,
hotels and marketplaces.[334] From 1993 to 2003, 303 Palestinian suicide bombers attacked Israel.
In 1994, Hamas initiated their first lethal suicide attack in response to the cave of the Patriarchs
massacre where American-Israeli physician Baruch Goldstein opened fire in a mosque, killing 29
people and injuring 125.[335]
The Israeli government initiated the construction of a security barrier following scores of suicide
bombings and terrorist attacks in July 2003. Israel's coalition government approved the security
barrier in the northern part of the green line between Israel and the West Bank. According to the
IDF, since the erection of the fence, terrorist acts have declined by approximately 90%.[336] The
decline in attacks can also be attributed to the permanent presence of Israeli troops inside and
around Palestinian cities and increasing security cooperation between the IDF and the Palestinian
Authority during this period.[337] The barrier followed a route that ran almost entirely through
land occupied by Israel in June 1967, unilaterally seizing more than 10% of the West Bank,
including whole neighborhoods and settlement blocs, while splitting Palestinian villages in half
with immediate effects on Palestinians' freedom of movement. The barrier, in some areas, isolated
farmers from their fields and children from their schools, while also restricting Palestinians from
moving within the West Bank or pursuing employment in Israel.[338][339][340]
In 2004 the International Court of Justice ruled that the construction of the barrier violated the
Palestinian right to self-determination, contravened the Fourth Geneva Convention, and could not
be justified as a measure of Israeli self-defense.[341] The ICJ further expressed that the
construction of the wall by Israel could become a permanent fixture, altering the status quo.
Israel's High Court, however, disagreed with the ICJ's conclusions, stating that they lacked a
factual basis. Several human rights organizations, including B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch, and
Amnesty International, echoed the ICJ's concerns. They suggested that the wall's route was
designed to perpetuate the existence of settlements and facilitate their future annexation into
Israel, and that the wall was a means for Israel to consolidate control over land used for illegal
settlements. The sophisticated structure of the wall also indicated its likely permanence.[342]
Since 2001, the threat of Qassam rockets fired from Palestinian territories into Israel continues to
be of great concern for Israeli defense officials.[343] In 2006—the year following Israel's
disengagement from the Gaza Strip—the Israeli government claimed to have recorded 1,726 such
launches, more than four times the total rockets fired in 2005.[328][344] As of January 2009, over
8,600 rockets have been launched,[345][346] causing widespread psychological trauma and
disruption of daily life.[347] As a result of these attacks, Israelis living in southern Israel have had to
spend long periods in bomb shelters. The relatively small payload carried on these rockets, Israel's
advanced early warning system, American-supplied anti-missile capabilities, and network of
shelters made the rockets rarely lethal. In 2014, out of 4,000 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip,
only six Israeli civilians were killed. For comparison, the payload carried on these rockets is
smaller than Israeli tank shells, of which 49,000 were fired in Gaza in 2014.[348]
There is significant debate within Israel about how to deal with the country's security concerns.
Options have included military action (including targeted killings and house demolitions of
terrorist operatives), diplomacy, unilateral gestures toward peace, and increased security measures
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_conflict

such as checkpoints, roadblocks and security barriers. The legality and the wisdom of all of the
above tactics have been called into question by various commentators.
Since mid-June 2007, Israel's primary means of dealing with security concerns in the West Bank
has been to cooperate with and permit United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding
of the Palestinian Authority's security forces, which with Israeli help have largely succeeded in
quelling West Bank supporters of Hamas.[349]

Water resources
In the Middle East, water resources are of great political concern. Since Israel receives much of its
water from two large underground aquifers which continue under the Green Line, the use of this
water has been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israel withdraws most water from
these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with approximately 40 million cubic metres
annually, contributing to 77% of Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared
for a population of about 2.6 million.[350]
While Israel's consumption of this water has decreased
since it began its occupation of the West Bank, it still
consumes the majority of it: in the 1950s, Israel consumed
95% of the water output of the Western Aquifer, and 82%
of that produced by the Northeastern Aquifer. Although
this water was drawn entirely on Israel's own side of the
pre-1967 border, the sources of the water are nevertheless
from the shared groundwater basins located under both
West Bank and Israel.[351]
In the Oslo II Accord, both sides agreed to maintain
"existing quantities of utilization from the resources." In so
doing, the Palestinian Authority established the legality of
Israeli water production in the West Bank, subject to a
Joint Water Committee (JWC). Moreover, Israel obligated
itself in this agreement to provide water to supplement
Palestinian production, and further agreed to allow
additional Palestinian drilling in the Eastern Aquifer, also
subject to the Joint Water Committee.[352][353] The water
that Israel receives comes mainly from the Jordan River
system, the Sea of Galilee and two underground sources.
According to a 2003 BBC article the Palestinians lack
access to the Jordan River system.[354]

According to a report of 2008 by the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, water resources were
confiscated for the benefit of the Israeli settlements in the Ghor. Palestinian irrigation pumps on
the Jordan River were destroyed or confiscated after the 1967 war and Palestinians were not
allowed to use water from the Jordan River system. Furthermore, the authorities did not allow any
new irrigation wells to be drilled by Palestinian farmers, while it provided fresh water and allowed
drilling wells for irrigation purposes at the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.[355]

A report was released by the UN in August 2012 and Max Gaylard, the UN Resident and
Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian territory, explained at the launch of the
publication: "Gaza will have half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only
slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder time getting enough drinking
water and electricity, or sending their children to school". Gaylard present alongside Jean Gough,
of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Robert Turner, of the UN Relief and Works Agency for
Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The report projects that Gaza's population will
increase from 1.6 million people to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than
5,800 people per square kilometre.[356]
Future and financing
Numerous foreign nations and international organizations have established bilateral agreements
with the Palestinian and Israeli water authorities. It was estimated that a future investment of
about US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn for the Gaza Strip Southern Governorates was
needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015.[357]
In late 2012, a donation of $21.6 million was announced by the Government of the Netherlands—
the Dutch government stated that the funds would be provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency
for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), for the specific benefit of Palestinian children.
An article, published by the UN News website, stated that: "Of the $21.6 million, $5.7 will be
allocated to UNRWA's 2012 Emergency Appeal for the occupied Palestinian territory, which will
support programmes in the West Bank and Gaza aiming to mitigate the effects on refugees of the
deteriorating situation they face."[356]

Agricultural rights
The conflict has been about land since its inception.[358] When Israel became a state after the war
in 1948, 77% of Palestine's land was used for the creation on the state.[359] The majority of those
living in Palestine at the time became refugees in other countries and this first land crisis became
the root of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[360] Because the root of the conflict is with land, the
disputes between Israel and Palestine are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.
In Palestine, agriculture is a mainstay in the economy. The production of agricultural goods
supports the population's sustenance needs and fuels Palestine's export economy.[361] According to
the Council for European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of
the population and informally employs 90% of the population.[361] Over the past 10 years,
unemployment rates in Palestine have increased and the agricultural sector became the most
impoverished sector in Palestine. Unemployment rates peaked in 2008 when they reached 41% in
Gaza.[362]
Palestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems including Israeli military and civilian
attacks on farms and farmers, blockades to exportation of produce and importation of necessary
inputs, widespread confiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military and settler use,
confiscation and destruction of wells, and physical barriers within the West Bank.[363]

Israel's West Bank barrier
With the construction of the separation barrier, the Israeli
state promised free movement across regions. However,
border closures, curfews, and checkpoints has significantly
restricted Palestinian movement.[364][365] In 2012, there
were 99 fixed check points and 310 flying checkpoints.[366]
The border restrictions impacted the imports and exports
in Palestine and weakened the industrial and agricultural
sectors because of the constant Israeli control in the West
Bank and Gaza.[367] In order for the Palestinian economy
to be prosperous, the restrictions on Palestinian land must

be removed.
According to The Guardian and a report
for World Bank, the Palestinian economy lost $3.4bn (%35
of the annual GDP) to Israeli restrictions in the West Bank alone.[368]

Palestinian violence outside of Israel
Some Palestinians have committed violent acts over the globe on the pretext of a struggle against
Israel.[369]
During the late 1960s, groups affiliated with the PLO became increasingly infamous for its use of
international terror. In 1969 alone, these groups were responsible for hijacking 82 planes. El Al
Airlines became a regular hijacking target.[370][371] The hijacking of Air France Flight 139 by the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine culminated during a hostage-rescue mission, where
Israeli special forces successfully rescued the majority of the hostages.
One of the most well-known and notorious terrorist acts was the capture and eventual murder of 11
Israeli athletes by the Black September Organization during the 1972 Summer Olympics.[372]

Palestinian-on-Palestinian violence
Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has
played a crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy
towards Palestinian militants, as well as in the Palestinian
leadership's own policies. As early as the 1930s revolts in
Palestine, Arab forces fought each other while also
skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal
conflicts continue to the present day.
In the First Intifada, more than a thousand Palestinians

were actually guilty of informing for Israel.[373]

Overriding authority and international status
As far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the
Palestinian Authority is derived from the Oslo Accords,
signed with the PLO, under which it acquired control over
cities in the Palestinian territories (Area A) while the
surrounding countryside came either under Israeli security
and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete
Israeli civil administration (Area C). Israel has built
additional highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area
without entering Palestinian cities in Area A. The initial
areas under Palestinian Authority control are diverse and
non-contiguous. The areas have changed over time by
subsequent negotiations, including Oslo II, Wye River and
Sharm el-Sheik. According to Palestinians, the separated
areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails
to address Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed
no agreement to withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting
in no reduction in the division of the Palestinian areas, and
the institution of a safe pass system, without Israeli
checkpoints, between these parts.

Area C, controlled by Israel under Oslo
Accords, in blue and red, in December
2011

Under the Oslo Accords, as a security measure, Israel has
insisted on its control over all land, sea and air border
crossings into the Palestinian territories, and the right to set import and export controls. This is to
enable Israel to control the entry into the territories of materials of military significance and of
potentially dangerous persons.
The PLO's objective for international recognition of the State of Palestine is considered by Israel as
a provocative "unilateral" act that is inconsistent with the Oslo Accords.

Economic disputes and boycotts
In Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and border closures and
restrictions placed by Israel.[374] The PA's Minister of Agriculture estimates that around US$1.2
billion were lost in September 2006 because of these security measures. This embargo was brought
on by Hamas' refusal to recognize Israel's right to statehood. As a result, as of 2007, the PA's
160,000 employees had not received their salaries in over one year.[375]

Fatalities
Studies provide aggregated casualty data for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. According to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 13,000 Israelis and Palestinians were killed in
the conflict between 1948 and 1997.[378] Other estimates give 14,500 killed between 1948 and
2009.[378][379] During the 1982 Lebanon War, Israel killed an estimated 20,000 Palestinians and
Lebanese, not including the 800–3,500 Palestinians killed in the Sabra-Shatila Massacre.[9]

Criticism of casualty statistics
The Israeli-based International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) claimed that Israeli
and Palestinian human rights groups overestimated the percentage of civilians killed since the IDF
suspected many of those killed to be possible militants.[391][392]
During Operation Cast Lead, Israeli figures reported the number of Palestinians killed at 1,166
Palestinian, 60 percent were classified as "terrorists" by Israeli officials. This discrepancy is
partially due to Israel's classification of Gazan police, who did not take part in hostilities, as
combatants. The broad consensus among human rights organizations is that these police were

primarily civilians, as they did not actively participate in hostilities nor were they part of armed
groups. The accuracy of Israeli casualty figures was further questioned based on the number of
children killed. Israel reported 89 Palestinian minors killed, whereas the human rights
organization B'Tselem reported 252, substantiating their figures with birth and death certificates
and other documents in almost all cases. The Israeli figures also stand out against the figures
published by the US Department of State, which reported the number killed "at close to 1,400
Palestinians, including more than 1,000 civilians."[393]

Landmines and unexploded ordnance
A comprehensive collection mechanism to gather land mine and explosive remnants of war (ERW)
casualty data does not exist for the Palestinian territories.[394] In 2009, the United Nations Mine
Action Centre reported that more than 2,500 mine and explosive remnants of war casualties
occurred between 1967 and 1998, at least 794 casualties (127 killed, 654 injured and 13 unknown)
occurred between 1999 and 2008 and that 12 people had been killed and 27 injured since the Gaza
War.[394] The UN Mine Action Centre identified the main risks as coming from "ERW left behind
by Israeli aerial and artillery weapon systems, or from militant caches targeted by the Israeli
forces."[394] There are at least 15 confirmed minefields in the West Bank on the border with
Jordan. The Palestinian National Security Forces do not have maps or records of the
minefields.[394]

Notes
a. The 1949–1956 Palestinian fedayeen insurgency culminated in the 1956 Suez Crisis.
b. The Palestinian Authority was created by and is ultimately accountable to the PLO (see
Palestinian Authority#Government and politics). Under the administration of Mahmoud Abbas
(2005–present), the PA has coordinated security with Israel and worked to suppress anti-Israel
militants.[1]
c. During the First Intifada.
d. Under the administration of Mahmoud Abbas (2005–present), the PA has coordinated security
with Israel and worked to suppress anti-Israel militants.[1]
e. Consists of the armed wings of Hamas and allied Palestinian militant organizations.
f. In addition to direct deaths, armed conflicts result in indirect deaths "attributable to the conflict".
Mortality due to indirect deaths could be due to a variety of causes, such as infectious
diseases.[24]
g. estimate for year end 2024[27]
h. Three factors made Israel's territorial offer less forthcoming than it initially appeared. First, the
91 percent land offer was based on the Israeli definition of the West Bank, but this differs by
approximately 5 percentage points from the Palestinian definition. Palestinians use a total area
of 5,854 square kilometers. Israel, however, omits the area known as No Man's Land (50 km2
near Latrun), post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 km2), and the territorial waters of the Dead Sea
(195 km2), which reduces the total to 5,538 km2
i. 50,021 Palestinians of which have been fully identified as of 24 March 2025.

are 'due to the indirect [sic] impacts of war: malnutrition, communicable disease, exacerbations
of noncommunicable disease, [and] maternal and infant disorders.'117 'Indirect' would be the

also on the Palestinians' ability to fight thereafter, and on the already fractured capabilities of
their national leadership. A high proportion of the Arab casualties included the most
experienced military cadres and enterprising fighters.6 By the end of the revolt, most of the top
Arab political leaders and thousands of other cadres, militants, and fighters were imprisoned,
interned by the British in the Seychelles, in exile, or dead. The British also confiscated large
quantities of arms and ammunition from the Arabs during the revolt, and continued to do so
during later years. By the end of the revolt, existing political divisions within the Palestinian
polity had become envenomed, leading to profound rifts between the majority supporting the
revolt and a minority that had become alienated from the leadership: the consequence was
assassinations, infighting, and further weakening of the Palestinian position. The impact of the
revolt on the Palestinian economy was also severe, although some of that damage was selfinflicted, as a boycott of British and Jewish goods and of the mandatory government during the
strike and the revolt simply opened up opportunities for the already larger Jewish-controlled
sector of the economy of Palestine to expand further."

Gaza as part of the military offensive they launched in the wake of the Hamas-led attacks
on 7 October 2023 while situating them within the broader context of Israel's unlawful
occupation, and system of apartheid against Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank,
including East Jerusalem, and Israel. It assesses allegations of violations and crimes under
international law by Israel in Gaza within the framework of genocide under international law,
concluding that there is sufficient evidence to believe that Israel's conduct in Gaza following
7 October 2023 amounts to genocide."

most appealing article in there commendation of the Commission was that about the 'forced
transfer' of Arabs from the future Jewish state. To Ben-Gurion this was an 'unparalleled
achievement'. It was 'the best of all solutions', according to Berl Katznelson. 'A distant
neighbour', he said, 'is better than a close enemy.' Transfer was such an ideal solution that 'it
must happen someday', he concluded. A strategy of phases, admittedly always vague and
anything but an articulate plan of action, could only prevail if a solution could be found to the
demographic problem. 'Transfer' was the magic formula. The idea of transfer for the Arabs had
a long pedigree in Zionist thought."

belief in Zionism's early years that the Palestinians could be 'spirited across the border', in
Herzl's words, or that they would simply 'fold their tents and slip away', to use Zangwill's
formulation, soon gave way to more realistic assessments. Between 1937 and 1948 extensive
secret discussions of transfer were held in the Zionist movement's highest bodies, including the
Zionist Agency Executive, the Twentieth Zionist Congress, the World Convention of Ihud
Po'alei Tzion (the top forum of the dominant Zionist world labour movement), and various
official and semi-official transfer committees."
54. Slater 2020, p. 348: "After reviewing Zionism and its consequences, I examined the onset of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the 1917–47 period, and argued that because the Zionists
wanted to ensure a large Jewish majority in the coming state of Israel, their leaders repeatedly
discussed the means by which most of the Palestinians could be expelled or induced to flee;
the euphemism they employed was "transfer." The scholarship on "transfer"—especially by
Israeli historians—leaves no doubt about its importance in the thinking of every major Zionist
leader before and after the creation of Israel."

population transfer, as a facile solution to the twin problems of the Arab landless peasants and
the creation of land reserves for Jewish settlement was for some time in the back of the minds
of the 2ionist leadership. In fact, in private discussions with the British, the Zionist leadership
put forward population transfer as a tentative suggestion but stopped short of formulating it into
a proposal for action."

63. Khalidi 2020, Chapter 1: "Of all the services Britain provided to the Zionist movement before
1939, perhaps the most valuable was the armed suppression of Palestinian resistance in the
form of the revolt. The bloody war waged against the country's majority, which left 10 percent of
the adult male Arab population killed, wounded, imprisoned, or exiled,55 was the best
illustration of the unvarnished truths uttered by Jabotinsky about the necessity of the use of
force for the Zionist project to succeed. To quash the uprising, the British Empire brought in two
additional divisions of troops, squadrons of bombers, and all the paraphernalia of repression
that it had perfected over many decades of colonial wars."
64. Khalidi 2020, Chapter 1: "IN SPITE OF the sacrifices made—which can be gauged from the
very large numbers of Palestinians who were killed, wounded, jailed, or exiled—and the revolt's
momentary success, the consequences for the Palestinians were almost entirely negative. The
savage British repression, the death and exile of so many leaders, and the conflict within their
ranks left the Palestinians divided, without direction, and with their economy debilitated by the
time the revolt was crushed in the summer of 1939. This put the Palestinians in a very weak
position to confront the now invigorated Zionist movement, which had gone from strength to
strength during the revolt, obtaining lavish amounts of arms and extensive training from the
British to help them suppress the uprising."

Palestinian historian later put it, they could not fathom why 37 percent of the population had
been given 55 percent of the land (of which they owned only 7 percent). Moreover, the Jews
had been given the best agricultural lands (the Coastal Plain and Jezreel and Jordan Valleys)
while the Arabs had received the 'bare and hilly' parts, as one Palestinian politician, 'Awni 'Abd
al-Hadi, told a Zionist agent. 162 More generally, 'the Palestinians failed to see why they
should be made to pay for the Holocaust. ... [And] they failed to see why it was not fair for the

79. Louwerse, Colter (2024). Stern-Weiner, Jamie (ed.). Deluge. OR Books. ISBN 978-1-68219619-9. "During the June 1967 Arab-Israel War, Israel came into military occupation of the
Palestinian West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip. (Israel also occupied the
Egyptian Sinai, Syrian Golan Heights, and two islands in the Gulf of Aqaba.) Already by the
mid-1970s, the international community converged on a framework for resolving the festering
conflict. This framework comprised two elements rooted in fundamental principles of
international law. The first called for Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian and
other Arab territories in exchange for Palestinian-Arab recognition of Israel. The second called
for establishing an independent State of Palestine on the Palestinian territories from which
Israel would withdraw, i.e., the West Bank and Gaza, as well as a "just resolution" of the
Palestinian refugee question.10 Land for peace and Palestinian self-determination secured
through a two-state settlement: these principles for a reasonable if imperfect resolution of the
Israel-Palestine conflict were eventually endorsed by an overwhelming consensus at the
International Court of Justice (ICJ), in the political organs of the United Nations (UN), and of
respected human rights organizations."

Israel was not as invincible as it had believed. The war left its scars on Israel, which suffered
over 2,500 dead, US$4 billion in direct monetary losses, and deflated confidence. Although the
Arabs technically lost the war, they won psychologically and diplomatically as the world once
again focused on the ongoing conflict.156 In 1973, the UN Security Council passed Resolution
338, affirming the land-for-peace framework enshrined in Resolution 242 and setting into
motion what was to become known as the Middle East peace process. Palestinian control of
the PLO and the rise of guerilla warfare, together with the shift ushered in by the 1973 War,
would lay the groundwork for the PLO's political agenda and aggressive legal strategy
throughout the decade that followed."
81. Slater 2020, p. 216: "The disastrous defeat of the Arab states in the 1973 war also played a
major role in convincing Arafat of the need for a compromise peace settlement. Arafat's
decision to start peace negotiations with Israel led to the June 1974 PLO agreement to adopt a
new strategy that called for a struggle for "every part of Palestine that is liberated" (emphasis
added). Anziska writes that this constituted "an acceptance of a political solution on a limited
piece of territory," the first step, however vague, that opened the door for a Palestinian
acceptance of a two-state solution... In a recent major work, historian Seth Anziska writes that
the 1973 war "launched a new phase in the PLO's struggle, oriented toward partition and the
acknowledgment of Israel's presence. In the aftermath of the October War, the PLO sought a
place within the comprehensive diplomatic negotiations, which required political compromise
and the eventual embrace of a state on far less territory than historic Palestine" (Anziska,
Preventing Palestine, Kindle 25). Similarly, Bird writes: "By mid-1974 the PLO was rapidly
moving away from a strategy of armed struggle and morphing into a political movement
seeking international legitimacy" based on a two-state solution (Bird, The Good Spy, Kindle
location 2560–75). For similar assessments of the importance of the 1974 PLO program, see

Arafat: A Mixed Legacy"; Tessler, A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Kindle 483–84;

82. Morris 1999, The Politics of War and Afterffects: "On the other hand, the war had given Israel a
stinging slap in the face. The 1948, 1956, and 1967 wars had conditioned them to stunning
victories over the Arabs and to Arab military (and political) incompetence; 1973 proved to be
something else altogether. Many Israelis were now persuaded that the territories could not be
held indefinitely by force and that continued occupation would necessarily lead to further bouts
of painful warfare. At last, and for the first time since June 1967, most people were willing to
contemplate giving up large chunks of land for peace."

83. Pappé 2022, pp. 287: "The 1973 war was a traumatic event that promoted the disintegration of
Israeli politics and culture. The myth of Israeli invincibility was shattered, and while some saw
this as a good reason to become more insistent in the search for peace, others turned to God,
toughening their positions on peace and territorial compromise. What added to the confusion
and the erosion of self-confidence was the high number of deaths, about 3,000, compared with
the few hundred in the 1967 war. A general sense of grief fell on the country and affected the
government's prestige."
84. Khalidi 2013, The First Moment: Begin and Palestinian Autonomy in 1982: "In addition to their
central provision, for a peace treaty between the two countries, the Camp David Accords,
agreed upon by Israel and Egypt under the aegis of the United States in 1978, called for
negotiations for the establishment of a "Self-Governing Authority" (SGA) for the Arab
population of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Jerusalem was to be excluded from its
provisions. The accords stipulated "full autonomy for the inhabitants," but crucially, this did not
apply to the land, which was to remain under full Israeli control. A bilateral peace treaty based
on these accords was signed between Israel and Egypt in 1979, and Israel thereafter began a
withdrawal of its forces from the occupied Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, which was completed in
the spring of 1982. However, the modalities of the Palestinian-autonomy accords were a
continuing source of dispute between the three signatories to the Camp David Accords, as well
as with the Palestinians and other Arabs, and in the end they were never implemented."
85. Shlaim 2015, The Camp David Accords: "The Camp David Accords were signed in an
impressive ceremony in the White House on 17 September 1978. The two accords were
entitled "A Framework for Peace in the Middle East" and "A Framework for the Conclusion of a
Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt." The former stated in its preamble, "The agreed basis
for a peaceful settlement of the conflict between Israel and its neighbours is UN Security
Council Resolution 242 in all its parts." The framework dealt with the West Bank and Gaza and
envisaged nothing less than "the resolution of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects." Egypt,
Israel, Jordan, and the representatives of the Palestinian people were to participate in the
negotiations, which were to proceed in three stages. In the first, the ground rules would be laid
for electing a "self-governing authority" for the territories, and the powers of this authority would
be defined. In the second stage, once the self-governing authority had been established, a
transitional period would begin. Israel's military government and its civilian administration
would be withdrawn; Israel's armed forces would also be withdrawn and the remaining forces
redeployed into specified security locations. In the third stage, not later than the third year after
the beginning of the transitional period, negotiations would take place to determine the final
status of the West Bank and Gaza. These negotiations had to recognize "the legitimate rights
of the Palestinian people and their just requirements."
86. Morris 1999, The Lebanon War: "The aim of "Operation Litani" was to kill as many guerrillas as
possible and to destroy the military infrastructure—camps, munitions dumps, artillery pieces. A
secondary aim was to expand, and create continuity between, the existing Christian-held
enclaves on the Lebanese side of the border. By March 21, the IDF had taken all of the area
south of the Litani (except for Tyre and its environs).

public during Begin's first term. Begin was impressed by the pleas and the aristocratic manner
of the Maronite leaders and several times declared "Israel will not allow genocide [of the
Maronites] in Lebanon." In March 1978, Israeli forces temporarily occupied southern Lebanon,
in an attempt to neutralize Palestinian guerilla groups and enlarge the territory controlled by
Major Haddad, in an undertaking called Operation Litani (the river that more or less marked the
boundary of the Israeli influence)."

88. Khalidi 2020, The Third Declaration of War: "Nevertheless, after all this and despite an Israeli
incursion in 1978—the Litani Operation—which left a swath of south Lebanon under the control
of its proxy, the South Lebanese Army, the PLO was still standing. Indeed, it remained the
strongest force in large parts of Lebanon, those that were not in the hands of foreign armies or
their proxies, including West Beirut, Tripoli, Sidon, the Shouf Mountains, and much of the
south. It would take one more military campaign to dislodge the PLO, and in 1982, American
Secretary of State General Alexander Haig agreed to Ariel Sharon's plans for Israel to finish off
the organization and with it Palestinian nationalism."
89. Cleveland & Bunton 2010: "This was that belt the Israeli government wished to destroy. Its first
concerted effort to do so occurred in 1978, when 25,000 Israeli troops invaded Lebanon as far
north as the Litani River. The operation failed to dislodge the PLO from its strongholds,
although it did cause large-scale demographic disruptions in southern Lebanon as thousands
of villagers, mainly Shi'as, fled their homelands for the area of Beirut. Pressure from the United
States and the UN eventually compelled Israel to withdraw its troops."

government in Israel, having secured its southern frontier by the peace treaty with Egypt, now
tried to impose its own solution of the problem of the Palestinians. This involved an attempt to
destroy both the military and the political power of the PLO in Lebanon, to install a friendly
regime there, and then, freed from effective Palestinian resistance, to pursue its policy of
settlement and annexation of occupied Palestine. With some degree of acquiescence from the
USA, Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982. The invasion culminated in a long siege of the
western part of Beirut, mainly inhabited by Muslims and dominated by the PLO. The siege
ended with an agreement, negotiated through the US government, by which the PLO would
evacuate west Beirut, with guarantees for the safety of Palestinian civilians given by the
Lebanese and US governments. At the same time, a presidential election resulted in the
military head of the Kata'ib, Bashir Jumayyil, becoming president; he was assassinated soon
afterwards and his brother Amin was then elected. The assassination was taken by Israel as an
opportunity to occupy west Beirut, and this allowed the Kata'ib to carry out a massacre of
Palestinians on a large scale in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila."

the PLO's infrastructure in Lebanon as well as dismantling the last remaining Palestinian
springboard in an Arab country for the military struggle against Israel, was the immediate
operational objective of the war. But the architects of the invasion had far wider ambitions.
They believed that the defeat of the Palestinians in Lebanon would trigger a mass exodus of
Palestinians to the East Bank of the River Jordan, which in turn would bring about the collapse
of the Hashemite dynasty and the Palestinisation of the kingdom in a way that would allow
Israel a free hand to assert her rule in Judaea and Samaria. Israel also believed that her victory
in Lebanon would create a new political order in that country with an undisputed Christian
hegemony."

92. Shlaim 2015, The Lebanese Quagmire 1981 –1984: "The real driving force behind Israel's
invasion of Lebanon, however, was Ariel Sharon, whose aims were much more ambitious and
far-reaching. From his first day at the Defense Ministry, Sharon started planning the invasion of
Lebanon. He developed what came to be known as the "big plan" for using Israel's military
power to establish political hegemony in the Middle East. The first aim of Sharon's plan was to
destroy the PLO's military infrastructure in Lebanon and to undermine it as a political
organization. The second aim was to establish a new political order in Lebanon by helping
Israel's Maronite friends, headed by Bashir Gemayel, to form a government that would proceed
to sign a peace treaty with Israel. For this to be possible, it was necessary, third, to expel the
Syrian forces from Lebanon or at least to weaken seriously the Syrian presence there. In
Sharon's big plan, the war in Lebanon was intended to transform the situation not only in
Lebanon but in the whole Middle East. The destruction of the PLO would break the backbone
of Palestinian nationalism and facilitate the absorption of the West Bank into Greater Israel.
The resulting influx of Palestinians from Lebanon and the West Bank into Jordan would
eventually sweep away the Hashemite monarchy and transform the East Bank into a
Palestinian state. Sharon reasoned that Jordan's conversion into a Palestinian state would end
international pressures on Israel to withdraw from the West Bank. Begin was not privy to all
aspects of Sharon's ambitious geopolitical scenario, but the two men were united by their
desire to act against the PLO in Lebanon."
93. Morris 1999: "On September 1 an IDF helicopter flew Gemayel to Nahariya, in northern Israel,
where he met Begin, who had just been informed of the "Reagan Plan," the new American
initiative for Israeli withdrawal from most of the occupied territories in exchange for Arab
recognition and peace. By invading Lebanon, Begin had hoped to neutralize Palestinian
nationalism and facilitate Israeli annexation, at least de facto, of the West Bank. But the
invasion had brought home to the Americans the plight of the Palestinians and the imperative
of resolving their problem, with Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank among the necessary
preconditions. The Reagan initiative ruled out a final settlement that would involve either Israeli
annexation of the territories or full-fledged Palestinian statehood."

&pg=PA). Pluto Press. ISBN 978-0-89608-601-2. "was that "Operation Peace for Galilee"—the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982—was undertaken to protect the civilian population from
Palestinian gunners, and that "the rocket and shelling attacks on Israel's northern border" were
ended by the operation, though "If rockets again rain down on Israel's northern border after all
that has been expended on Lebanon, the Israeli public will be outraged.19 This cannot be
correct, given the history which is not challenged (even if unreported, for the most part). When
it came to be recognized that the rockets still "rain down," the story was modified: "Israel's two
military forays into Lebanon [1978, 1982] were military disasters that failed to provide long-term
security for Israel's northern border."20 Security had indeed been at risk, as a result of Israel's
unprovoked attacks from 1981, and to a large extent before. The phrase "military disaster"
does not refer to the killing of some 20,000 Lebanese and Palestinians in 1982,
overwhelmingly civilians, the destruction of much of southern Lebanon and the capital city of
Beirut, or the terrible atrocities carried out by Israeli troops through the mid-1980s; rather, to
Israel's failure to impose the "new order" it had proclaimed for Lebanon and its inability to
maintain its occupation in full because of the casualties caused by unanticipated resistance
("terror"), forcing it back to its "security zone." The actual reasons for the 1982 invasion have
never been concealed in Israel, though they are rated "X" here.21 A few weeks after the
invasion began, Israel's leading academic specialist on the Palestinians, Yehoshua Porath,
pointed out that the decision to invade "flowed from the very fact that the cease-fire had been
observed" by the PLO, a "veritable catastrophe" for the Israeli government because it
endangered the policy of evading a political settlement. The PLO was gaining respectability
thanks to its preference for negotiations over terror. The Israeli government's hope, therefore,
was to compel "the stricken PLO" to "return to its earlier terrorism," thus "undercutting the
danger" of negotiations. As Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir later stated, Israel went to war
because there was "a terrible danger... Not so much a military one as a political one." The
invasion was intended to "undermine the position of the moderates within [the PLO] ranks" and
thus to block "the PLO 'peace offensive"' and "to halt [the PLO's] rise to political respectability"
(strategic analyst Avner Yaniv); it should be called "the war to safeguard the occupation of the
West Bank," having been motivated by Begin's "fear of the momentum of the peace process,"
according to Israeli Arabist and former head of military intelligence General Yehoshaphat
Harkabi. U.S. backing for Israel's aggression, including the vetoing of Security Council efforts
to stop the slaughter, was presumably based on the same reasoning. After its failure to impose
the intended "New Order" in Lebanon in 1982, Israel attempted to hold on to as much of
Lebanon as possible, though it was forced to withdraw to its "security zone" as resistance
caused too many Israeli casualties. Meanwhile Israel conducted violent terror operations,
notably the "iron fist" operations of 1985 under the direction of Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
These went on through the 1980s.2"

not attack Israel from mid-I98r to mid-I982.16 But in June 1982 Israel again invaded Lebanon,
and it used aerial bombardment to destroy entire camps of Palestine Arab refugees.17 By
these means Israel killed 20,000 persons, mostly civilians,18 and while it occupied southern
Lebanon it incarcerated 15,000 persons, according to the International Committee of the Red
Cross. The IDF continued north to Beirut, where it forced the PLO out of Lebanon. Israel
claimed self-defense for its invasion, but the lack of PLO attacks into Israel during the previous
year made that claim dubious. By invading Lebanon, Israel evidently sought to destroy the
extensive Palestinian military and administrative infrastructure in Lebanon19 and, by removing
the PLO, to convince the Arabs of the Gaza Strip and West Bank that they would get no help
from the PLO.20 In the United States Harold Saunders, a former assistant secretary of state for
Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, said that Israel aimed,"

96. Slater 2020, p. 354: "For just that reason, though, Prime Minister Menachem Begin and
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon worried that the growing PLO moderation would increase the
pressure on Israel to accept the creation of a Palestinian state. To prevent that, in 1982 they
seized upon a pretext to again invade Lebanon and attack the PLO, this time on a far larger
scale than in previous conflicts. The attacks resulted in tens of thousands of Lebanese civilian
casualties; however, the PLO forces in southern Lebanon, still led by Arafat, who escaped
Israeli efforts to kill him, were soon reconstituted."

134. Shlaim 2015: "The PLO followed the Algiers resolutions with a concerted attempt to project a
more moderate image. It made a special effort to gain respectability by dissociating the PLO
from terrorism. Arafat issued a series of statements on the subject, which failed to satisfy the
United States, so in the end the State Department virtually dictated the text that Arafat read at
the opening of his press conference in Geneva on 14 December. "I repeat for the record,"
stated Arafat, "that we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including
individual, group and state terrorism. Between Geneva and Algiers we have made our position
crystal clear." The statement unconditionally accepted Resolutions 242 and 338 and clearly
recognized Israel's right to exist. All the conditions that Henry Kissinger had laid down in 1975
for dealing with the PLO had now been met. One of the last major foreign policy acts of the
outgoing Reagan administration was to recognize the PLO and to open a substantive dialogue
with it. This dialogue was conducted by the American ambassador in Tunis. President Reagan
stated publicly that the special commitment of the United States to Israel's security and wellbeing remained unshakable."
135. Shlaim 2015: "To Shamir it was crystal clear, once again, that the PLO had not abandoned the
path of terror. For him the PLO had always been and would forever remain a terrorist
organization. His response to the momentous changes taking place in the Palestinian camp
was a reaffirmation of his previous position: no to withdrawal from the occupied territories, no
to recognition of the PLO, no to negotiation with the PLO, no to a Palestinian state. Shamir
called the U.S. decision to enter into a dialogue with the PLO a "grave error." He saw it as a
threat to the long-standing American-Israeli collaboration in support of the territorial status quo.
"For the PLO," explained Shamir, "a Palestinian state is a minimum. Therefore, anyone who
engages in negotiations with it in effect accepts this principle. What else can one talk about
with the PLO, if not about a Palestinian state?" Vice-Premier Peres described the opening of
the U.S.-PLO dialogue as "a sad day for all of us." But he felt that Israel had to come up with its
own peace initiative, since it was impossible to preserve the status quo."

revoke its original charter, which had denied the legitimacy of Israel and called for the armed
liberation of all of Palestine. As well, by 1996 the PA and its police forces had become
increasingly successful in their efforts to end the terrorism of Hamas and other Islamic
extremists, even cooperating with the Israeli forces. As a result, there were now far fewer
terrorist attacks than in the preceding few years."

"Camp David failed because of the two sides' conflicting interpretations of the terms of
reference of the peace process. The Israelis came to the negotiations with the conviction
inherent in the letter of the Oslo Accords that this was an open-ended process where no
preconceived solutions existed and where every one of the core issues would be open to
negotiation so that a reasonable point of equilibrium between the needs of the parties could be
found. The Palestinians saw the negotiations as a step in a journey where they would get their
rights as if this were a clear-cut process of decolonization based on "international legitimacy"
and "all UN relevant resolutions." "
155. Finkelstein 2007, p. 352
156. Finkelstein 2007, p. 352: "In a letter to President Clinton, who presided over the proceedings,
Palestinian representatives stated that their aim was implementation of U.N. Resolution 242
and that "[w]e are willing to accept adjustments of the border between the two countries, on
condition that they be equivalent in value and importance." Repeatedly the Palestinian
negotiators asked: "Will you accept the June 4border [as the basis of discussion]? Will you
accept the principle of the exchange of territories?" The Israeli position was that "[w]e can't
accept the demand for a return to the borders of June 1967as a pre-condition for the
negotiation," while Clinton "literally yells," in response to the Palestinian view that "international
legitimacy means Israeli retreat to the border of 4 June 1967," that "[t]his isn't the Security
Council here. This isn't the U.N. General Assembly."

164. Slater 2020: "After Camp David, a new mythology emerged perpetrated by Barak and his
foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, with the support of Dennis Ross, Clinton's secretary of state
Madeleine Albright, and to a considerable extent Clinton himself. The mythology holds that at
Camp David, Barak made a generous and unprecedented offer to the Palestinians, only to be
met by a shocking if not perverse rejection by Arafat who then ordered a violent uprising at just
the moment when the chances for peace had never been greater. For example, shortly after
the conclusion of Camp David, Ben-Ami gave a long interview with Haaretz, claiming that
Arafat did not go to Camp David to reach a compromise settlement but rather treated the
negotiations as "a huge camouflage net behind which he sought to undermine the very idea of
two states for two nations. ... Camp David collapsed over the fact that [the Palestinians]
refused to get in the game. They refused to make a counterproposal ... and didn't succeed in
conveying ... that at some point the demands would have an end." The implied premise of
Barak and Ben-Ami was that Arafat thought the Palestinians held all the cards, so that if he
held out long enough, he would eventually reach his goal: the destruction of Israel in stages
and the takeover of all of historic Palestine. This view became widely accepted in US and
Israeli public opinion... This and other Camp David mythologies have been rejected, both at the
time and in retrospect, by nearly all scholars and knowledgeable journalists and by most Israeli
and US officials who participated in the negotiations. In particular, they were challenged in
interviews and memoirs by the leading Israeli negotiators, among them Ron Pundak, Yossi
Beilin, Oden Era, Shaul Arieli, Yossi Ginosser, Moshe Amirav, and General Amnon LipkinShahak, chief of staff of the IDF in 1995–1998. As well, the mythologies were strongly—and
subsequently, publicly—rejected by Israel's leading military intelligence officials, including Ami
Ayalon, the 2000 head of Shin Bet, and Matti Steinberg, his chief advisor—and by Amos
Malka, head of the IDF's military intelligence bureau, and his second in command, Ephraim
Lavie."

critical view of both deportations and settlements as being contrary to international law.
General Assembly resolutions have condemned the deportations since 1969, and have done
so by overwhelming majorities in recent years. Likewise, they have consistently deplored the
establishment of settlements, and have done so by overwhelming majorities throughout the
period (since the end of 1976) of the rapid expansion in their numbers. The Security Council
has also been critical of deportations and settlements; and other bodies have viewed them as
an obstacle to peace, and illegal under international law... Although East Jerusalem and the
Golan Heights have been brought directly under Israeli law, by acts that amount to annexation,
both of these areas continue to be viewed by the international community as occupied, and
their status as regards the applicability of international rules is in most respects identical to that
of the West Bank and Gaza."

security barrier concerns the fate of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. Since
1967, Israel has allowed and even encouraged its citizens to live in the new settlements
established in the territories, motivated by religious and national sentiments attached to the
history of the Jewish nation in the land of Israel. This policy has also been justified in terms of
security interests, taking into consideration the dangerous geographic circumstances of Israel
before 1967 (where Israeli areas on the Mediterranean coast were potentially threatened by
Jordanian control of the West Bank ridge). The international community, for its part, has viewed
this policy as patently illegal, based on the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention that
prohibit moving populations to or from territories under occupation."

into the occupied territories violates not only the laws of belligerent occupation but the
Palestinian right of self-determination under international law. The question remains, however,
whether this is of any practical value. In other words, given the view of the international
community that the Israeli settlements are illegal under the law if belligerent occupation, what
purpose does it serve to establish that an additional breach of international law has occurred?"

217. Baconi 2018: "Sharon's plan was the latest in a long series of measures Israel had taken to
separate the Gaza Strip from the West Bank. Although policies of isolation reach back to the
1950s, more contemporary measures began with the "soft quarantining" of Gaza after the
signing of the Oslo Accords, including the gradual tightening of border crossings and the
construction of barriers to geographically sever the coastal enclave from Israel.9 Sharon's
initiative also reflected a continuation of his use of the pretext of security to unilaterally
consolidate Israel's grip on the territories while avoiding any form of political engagement with
the Palestinians. This goal was explicitly articulated by Sharon's top aide, Dov Weisglass, in an
interview several months later. "The disengagement is actually formaldehyde," Weisglass told
the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. "It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so
that there will not be a political process with the Palestinians."
218. Roy 2016: "But complete control over the West Bank-the obvious goal of the settlement
enterprise and the separation barrier-cannot be achieved as long as Gaza remains a source of
resistance and as along as the possibility of a unified Palestinian state exists."

227. Cited in Roy 2016: "This situation has not substantially changed: In late 2012, the World Bank
reported that "access to Gaza remains highly controlled, and only consumer goods and
construction material for donor-supervised projects are allowed in. Products from Gaza to the
West Bank and Israeli markets.. are prohibited. Only small shipments of certain agricultural and
manufactured products are exported to other markets through donor-supported projects. East
Jerusalem, which is considered a highly lucrative market, is beyond reach." The virtual ban on
exports from Gaza has not been lifted to this day (August 2014). Israel has claimed security
reasons, but since the prohibitions involved such items as furniture destined for PA schools in
the West Bank,» citrus fruit to West Bank grocers, and textiles to Israeli companies," it is
difficult not to conclude that the restrictions have little if anything to do with security. Instead,
their purpose clearly is to maintain the separation of Gaza and the West Bank. Indeed, Israeli
security officials themselves have attribut- ed the export ban "to a political decision to separate
Gaza from the West Bank." The government terms the policy a "political-security" necessity.*°
Significantly, "decisions regarding [the] sale of goods from Gaza to the West Bank.. could only
be made by the prime minister's office.""' Diminution of the Private Sector: Some Statistics
Among the consequences of the blockade (worsened by severe economic restrictions and
continuing military assaults) is the extreme degradation of Gaza's private sector and productive
base...The Israeli government officially justifies closure as a security measure despite the fact
that the Israeli security establishment itself has stated that closure is of limited value against
extremist attacks."

books?id=hnhXEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA). Prophets Without Honor. Oxford University Press.
ISBN 978-0-19-006047-3. "But the abject submission of the Palestinians and the ever
deepening system of occupation and discrimination in the territories are Israel's sole and
exclusive responsibility. As brilliantly explained by Michael Sfard, this is a system built on three
pillars: the gun, the settlements, and the law that formalizes the network of colonization.1
Under the mantle of security claims, the Jewish state has created in the Palestinian territories
one of the most efficient occupation regimes in history, which is, moreover, also cost-effective,
for it is the international community's donor money to the Palestinian Authority that saves the
occupier the burden of having to directly administer the territories. This leaves Israel free to
cater to its insatiable security needs with draconic measures, such as limiting the Palestinians'
freedom of movement, erecting walls that separate communities, dotting roads with
checkpoints where innocent people are manhandled, activating sophisticated intelligence
mechanisms that control the lives of an ever growing number of suspects, conducting surprise
searches of private houses in the middle of the night, and carrying out arbitrary administrative
detentions. If this were not enough, vigilantes among the settlers, some known as "the Youth of
the Hills," constantly harass Palestinian communities, destroy orchard trees, and arbitrarily
apply a "price tag" of punishments to innocent civilians for whatever terrorist attack might have
been perpetrated by a Palestinian squad. Underlying this very serious problem of the
unpardonable depravity of settlers' extremism is the even more serious problem that has to do
with the involvement of the entire Israeli body politic in maintaining and continuously expanding
a regime of dominance in the territories. For too long, the peace process has served as a
curtain behind which the policy of practical annexation has flourished."

meanwhile, live between 4 and 6 million Palestinians (reliable figures are not available). They
exist in situations ranging from the utter misery (since 1982) of those in refugee camps in
Lebanon, to a wide diversity of conditions, some of them quite comfortable, in various other
Arab countries, Europe, and the United States. These Palestinians 'of the diaspora' (al-shatat
in Arabic) possess a variety of passports, laissez-passers, and refugee documents, some of
which are looked upon with great suspicion by certain states, and some of them face harsh
restrictions on their movement in consequence. The largest single group of Palestinians of the
diaspora, between 2 and 3 million, carry Jordanian passports, and most of them live in Jordan.
What unites the overwhelming majority of these 4 to 6 million people is that they or their
parents or grandparents were obliged to leave their homes and became refugees in 1948 or
afterward, and that they are barred from living in any part of their ancestral homeland,
Palestine."
299. Slater 2020, p. 265: "Refugees. Israel agreed that the refugee problem was a regrettable
humanitarian issue, Barak stated, and would recognize the right of the Palestinians to return to
their own state, but that "no right of return to Israeli territory would prevail." However, he
continued, Israel was prepared to admit several hundred refugees annually for a ten- to fifteenyear period, under a family unification program. In a later interview, Barak made it clear that the
"family unification program" was not based on any Palestinian rights: "No Israeli prime minister
will accept even one refugee on the basis of the right of return."

have the right to return to their lands, homes, and villages. Arafat reiterated that "demand" at
Camp David, though he and other Palestinian leaders repeatedly assured the Americans and
the Israelis that their real goal was Israeli acceptance only of the "principle" of refugee return,
as distinct from implementing that "right" in practice."

namely the consolidation of a Jewish state through the mass immigration of the survivors of the
Nazi Holocaust in Europe and the uprooted and dispossessed Jews of North Africa and the
Arab Middle East... No Israeli statesman, either in 1948 or in 2005, would conceive of peace
based on the massive repatriation of Palestinian refugees as an offer the Jewish state could
accept and yet survive. The ethos of Zionism was twofold; it was about demography—
ingathering the exiles in a viable Jewish state with as small an Arab minority as possible—and
land."

325. Khalidi 2013, Introduction: "Similarly, in this lexicon, "security" is an absolute priority of Israel's,
the need for which is invariably described as rooted in genuine, deep-seated existential fears.
"Israeli security" therefore takes precedence over virtually everything else, including
international law and the human rights of others. It is an endlessly expansive concept that
includes a remarkable multitude of things, such as whether pasta or generator parts can be
brought into the Gaza Strip, or whether miserably poor Palestinian villagers can be allowed
water cisterns.1 By contrast, in spite of the precarious nature of their situation, Palestinians are
presumed not to have any significant concerns about their security. This is the case even
though nearly half the Palestinian population have lived for more than two generations under a
grinding military occupation without the most basic human, civil, or political rights, and the rest
have for many decades been dispersed from their ancestral homeland, many of them living
under harsh, authoritarian Arab governments."

327. Slater 2020, p. 221: "In any event, there was no legitimate security argument at all for the
Israeli seizure of Arab East Jerusalem immediately after the 1967 war and for subsequently
settling religious fanatics in the West Bank. The real motivating forces for most of the postwar
Israeli expansionism into the West Bank and East Jerusalem were clearly "Greater Israel"
nationalism and religious messianism. If anything, as many Israeli security experts pointed out
at the time, the "need" to defend the settlers was a security liability... Israeli governments have
long cited "security" as the reason they need to maintain occupation of Arab territories—but
when Israel withdrew from Lebanon and Egyptian territory, the attacks against it ended. It is
unlikely that an Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories would have a different result—
and if it did, there would be little to prevent Israel from reinvading and occupying those
territories. Moreover, in those circumstances repression of any continuing Palestinian violence
would have a legitimacy that it currently lacks. For these reasons, Israel has a security problem
with the Palestinians only in the same way that colonial powers had "security problems" with
nationalist uprisings that eventually forced them to withdraw."

335. Baconi 2018, Military Resistance Comes Undone: "On February 25, 1994, an American Jewish
settler named Baruch Goldstein walked into the Ibrahimi Mosque in the West Bank city of
Hebron during prayer time. Standing behind the rows of kneeling figures in front of him,
Goldstein opened fire. Within minutes, twenty-nine Muslim worshippers had been killed and
close to one hundred injured. The atrocity jolted the nascent Israeli-Palestinian bilateral
negotiations that had gathered pace in the wake of the First Intifada, prompted by the PLO's
strategic redirection in 1988. Less than six months before the Hebron attack, in September
1993, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin had awkwardly
shaken hands in a widely publicized event on the South Lawn of the White House. The leaders
had assembled in the American capital to sign the Declaration of Principles on Interim SelfGovernment Arrangements, popularly known as the Oslo Accords, referring to the capital city
where the secretive talks leading to the agreement had taken place. Following the signing,
negotiations between Israel and the PLO in the form of a "peace process" were launched.1
Goldstein's attack served as a reminder of the bloody challenges this process faced. Forty-one
days after the shooting, once the time allotted for Muslim ritual mourning had been respected,
a member of Hamas approached a bus stop in Afula, a city in northern Israel. Standing next to
fellow passengers, the man detonated a suicide vest, killing seven Israelis. This was on April 6,
1994, a day that marked Hamas's first lethal suicide bombing in Israel."

construction of the barrier (130 in 2003 and fewer than 25 in 2005), convincing most Israelis
that it saved the lives of fellow Israelis and was necessary for their security. However, the
decline in bombings can also be attributed to the permanent presence of Israeli troops inside
and around Palestinian cities and increasing security cooperation between the IDF and the PA,
particularly after the Second Intifada ended in 2005."

340. Baconi 2018, Chapter 3: "Rather than building the wall on Israeli land or along the 1967
borders, however, the structure snaked through Palestinian territories, unilaterally seizing more
than 10 percent of the West Bank, including whole neighborhoods around East Jerusalem as
well as major settlement blocs that were integrated into this de facto border. The structure split
whole Palestinian villages in half and had an immediate effect on the freedom of movement for
Palestinians within the occupied territories. Jewish settlers living illegally within the same land
continued to be linked into Israel through exclusive Jewish-only highways and bypass roads.
On July 20, 2004, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion ruling that the
wall was illegal, to no effect.4 With Israel's planned disengagement from the Gaza Strip and
the construction of advanced "security" infrastructure, Sharon was actively restructuring the
framework of Israel's occupation."

opposed to along the 1949 armistice line, violated the Palestinian right to self-determination,
contravened the Fourth Geneva Convention, and could not be justified as a measure of Israeli
self-defense. It advised Israel to "terminate its breaches of international law; it is under an
obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall being built in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, to dismantle forthwith the
structure therein situated." The court also observed that all states had an obligation "not to
recognize the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall and not to render aid or
assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction." "

of the wall and its associated régime create a 'fait accompli' on the ground that could well
become permanent."115 Taking note of this ICJ concern, Israel's High Court rejoined that the
ICJ lacked a "factual basis" for reaching definite conclusions.116 Not just the ICJ, however, but
also many respected human rights organizations expressed such worries. B'Tselem concluded
that the "underlying reason" of the wall's route was "to establish facts on the ground that would
perpetuate the existence of settlements and facilitate their future annexation into Israel."
Likewise, Human Rights Watch concluded that the "existing and planned route of the barrier
appears to be designed chiefly to incorporate and make contiguous with Israel illegal civilian
settlements." Likewise, Amnesty International concluded that Israel was building the wall to
"consolidate its control over land which is being used for illegal Israeli settlements," and that
"the very expensive and sophisticated structure of the fence/wall indicates that it is likely
intended as a permanent structure."117"

ks?id=Gaza&pg=PA). Univ of California Pres8. ISBN 978-0-520-96838-7. "Israeli officials
alleged that total Palestinian deaths came to 1,166, of whom at least 60 percent were
"terrorists." The discrepancy in the ratio of Palestinian combatant to civilian deaths partly
resulted from disagreement on the proper classification of Gazan police. See Shay Fogelman,
"Shock and Awe," Haaretz (31 December 2010). The broad consensus among human rights
organizations was that these police should overwhelmingly be classified as civilians because
they did not take a direct part in hostilities and were not members of Palestinian armed groups.
The veracity of Israeli figures could be tested by scrutinizing the "under 16" subclassification.
Whereas Israel alleged that 89 Palestinians under age 16 were killed, B'Tselem reported that
252 Palestinians under 16 were killed and that it had "copies of birth certificates and death
certificates along with other documents regarding the vast majority of the minors who were
killed." For critical analysis of Israeli casualty figures, see Public Committee against Torture in
Israel (PCATI), No Second Thoughts: The changes in the Israeli Defense Forces' combat
doctrine in light of "Operation Cast Lead" (2009), pp. 9–11. This study showed that Israel
abruptly altered the figures it tabulated for Palestinian deaths, and concluded that "the casualty
estimates provided by other sources (around 1,400 killed) are more credible than those
provided by the IDF Spokesperson." Even the largely apologetic US Department of State 2009
Human Rights Report put the number of dead "at close to 1,400 Palestinians, including more
than 1,000 civilians." "
